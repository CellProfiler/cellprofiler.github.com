<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>MeasureImageAreaOccupied</title></head><body><h1>Module: MeasureImageAreaOccupied</h1><div><b> Measure Image Area Occupied</b> measures the total area in an image that is  occupied by objects. <hr> This module reports the sum of the areas and perimeters of the objects defined by one of the <b>Identify</b> modules, or the area of the foreground in a binary image. If the input image has a mask (for example, created by the <b>MaskImage</b> module), the measurements made by this module will take the mask into account by ignoring the pixels outside the mask.<p><p>You can use this module to measure the number of pixels above a given threshold  if you precede it with thresholding performed by <b>ApplyThreshold</b>, and then  select the binary image output by <b>ApplyThreshold</b> to be measured by this module.</p><p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <ul> <li><i>AreaOccupied:</i> The total area occupied by the input objects or binary image.</li> <li><i>Perimeter:</i> The total length of the perimeter of the input objects/binary image.</li> <li><i>TotalImageArea:</i> The total pixel area of the image.</li> </ul><p>See also <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>, <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>, <b>IdentifyTertiaryObjects</b> </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Measure the area occupied in a binary image, or in objects?</h4><div>
                    The area can be measured in two ways:
                    <ul>
                    <li><i>Binary Image:</i> The area occupied by the foreground in a binary (black 
                    and white) image.</li>
                    <li><i>Objects:</i> The area occupied by previously-identified objects.</li>
                    </ul></div><h4>Select objects to measure</h4><div>
                    <i>(Used only if 'Objects' are to be measured)</i> <br>
                    Select the previously identified objects you would like to measure.</div><h4>Retain a binary image of the object regions?</h4><div>
                    <i>(Used only if 'Objects' are to be measured)</i><br>
                    Select <i>Yes</i> if you would like to use a binary image 
                    later in the pipeline, for example in <b>SaveImages</b>.  The image will 
                    display the object area that you have measured as the foreground 
                    in white and the background in black. </div><h4>Name the output binary image</h4><div>
                    <i>(Used only if the binary image of the objects is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i> <br> 
                    Specify a name that will allow the binary image of the objects to be selected later in the pipeline.</div><h4>Select a binary image to measure</h4><div>
                    <i>(Used only if 'Binary Image' is to be measured)</i><br>
                    This is a binary image created earlier in the pipeline, 
                    where you would like to measure the area occupied by the foreground 
                    in the image.</div></div></body></html>
