<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>MaskObjects</title></head><body><h1>Module: MaskObjects</h1><div><b>Mask Objects</b> removes objects outside of a specified region or regions. <hr> This module allows you to delete the objects or portions of objects that are  outside of a region (mask) you specify. For example, after identifying nuclei and tissue regions in previous <b>Identify</b> modules, you might want to exclude all nuclei that are outside of a tissue region.  <p><p>If using a masking image, the mask is composed of the foreground (white portions);  if using a masking object, the mask is composed of the area within the object.  You can choose to remove only the portion of each object that is outside of the region, remove the whole object if it is partially or fully outside of the region, or retain the whole object unless it is fully outside of the region. </p><p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <b>Parent object measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Count:</i> The number of new masked objects created from each parent object.</li> </ul><p><b>Masked object measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Parent:</i> The label number of the parent object.</li> <li><i>Location_X, Location_Y:</i> The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center of  mass of the masked objects.</li> </ul> </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select objects to be masked</h4><div>
            Select the objects that will be masked (that is, excluded in whole 
            or in part based on the other settings in the module). 
            You can choose from any objects created by
            a previous object processing module, such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>,
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b> or <b>IdentifyTertiaryObjects</b>.</div><h4>Name the masked objects</h4><div>
            Enter a name for the objects that remain after
            the masking operation. You can refer to the masked objects in
            subsequent modules by this name.</div><h4>Mask using a region defined by other objects or by binary image?</h4><div>
            You can mask your objects by defining a region using objects
            you previously identified in your pipeline (<i>Objects</i>) or by defining a 
            region based on the white regions in a binary image (<i>Image</i>).</div><h4>Select the masking object</h4><div>
            Select the objects that will be used to define the
            masking region. You can choose from any objects created
            by a previous object processing module, such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>,
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>, or <b>IdentifyTertiaryObjects</b>.</div><h4>Select the masking image</h4><div>
            Select an image that was either loaded or
            created by a previous module. The image should be a binary image where 
            the white portion of the image is the region(s) you will use for masking.
            Binary images can be loaded from disk using the 
            <b>NamesAndTypes</b> module by selecting "Binary mask" for the image type. 
            You can also create a binary image from a grayscale
            image using <b>ApplyThreshold</b>.</div><h4>Invert the mask?</h4><div>
            This option reverses the foreground/background relationship of
            the mask. 
            <ul>
            <li>Select <i>No</i> for the mask to be composed of the foregound 
            (white portion) of the masking image or the area within the masking 
            objects.</li>
            <li>Select <i>Yes</i> for the mask to instead be composed of the 
            <i>background</i> (black portions) of the masking image or the area 
            <i>outside</i> the masking objects.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Handling of objects that are partially masked</h4><div>
            An object might partially overlap the mask region, with
            pixels both inside and outside the region. <b>MaskObjects</b>
            can handle this in one of three ways:<br>
            <ul>
            <li><i>Keep overlapping region:</i> Choosing this option
            will reduce the size of partially overlapping objects. The part
            of the object that overlaps the region will be retained. The
            part of the object that is outside of the region will be removed.</li>
            <li><i>Keep:</i> If you choose this option, <b>MaskObjects</b> 
            will keep the whole object if any part of it overlaps the masking
            region.</li>
            <li><i>Remove:</i> Objects that are partially outside
            of the masking region will be completely removed if you choose
            this option.</li>
            <li><i>Remove depending on overlap:</i> Determine whether to
            remove or keep an object depending on how much of the object
            overlaps the masking region. <b>MaskObjects</b> will keep an
            object if at least a certain fraction (which you enter below) of
            the object falls within the masking region. <b>MaskObjects</b>
            completely removes the object if too little of it overlaps
            the masking region.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Fraction of object that must overlap</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if removing based on a overlap)</i><br>
            Specify the minimum fraction of an object
            that must overlap the masking region for that object to be retained.
            For instance, if the fraction is 0.75, then 3/4 of an object
            must be within the masking region for that object to be retained.</div><h4>Numbering of resulting objects</h4><div>
            Choose how to number the objects that 
            remain after masking, which controls how remaining objects are associated with their predecessors:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Renumber:</i> The objects that remain will be renumbered 
            using consecutive numbers. This
            is a good choice if you do not plan to use measurements from the
            original objects; your object measurements for the
            masked objects will not have gaps (where removed objects are missing).</li>
            <li><i>Retain:</i>: The original labels for the objects will be retained. 
            This allows any measurements you make from 
            the masked objects to be directly aligned with measurements you might 
            have made of the original, unmasked objects (or objects directly 
            associated with them).</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Retain outlines of the resulting objects?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to retain the outlines of the new objects 
for later use in the pipeline. For example, a common use is for quality control purposes by 
overlaying them on your image of choice using the <b>OverlayOutlines</b> module and then saving 
the overlay image with the <b>SaveImages</b> module.</div><h4>Name the outline image</h4><div>
            
<i>(Used only if the outline image is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i> <br>
Enter a name for the outlines of the identified 
objects. The outlined image can be selected in downstream modules by selecting 
them from any drop-down image list.</div></div></body></html>
