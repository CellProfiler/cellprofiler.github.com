<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>TrackObjects</title></head><body><h1>Module: TrackObjects</h1><div> <b>Track Objects</b> allows tracking objects throughout sequential  frames of a series of images, so that from frame to frame each object maintains a unique identity in the output measurements <hr> This module must be placed downstream of a module that identifies objects (e.g., <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>). <b>TrackObjects</b> will associate each object with the same object in the frames before and after. This allows the study  of objects' lineages and the timing and characteristics of dynamic events in  movies.<p><p>Images in CellProfiler are processed sequentially by frame (whether loaded as a  series of images or a movie file). To process a collection of http://d1zymp9ayga15t.cloudfront.net/images/movies,  you will need to do the following: <ul> <li>Define each individual movie using metadata  either contained within the image file itself or as part of the images nomenclature  or folder structure. Please see the <b>Metadata</b> module for more details on metadata collection and usage.</li> <li>Group the movies to make sure  that each image sequence is handled individually. Please see the <b>Groups</b> module for more details on the  proper use of metadata for grouping. </li> </ul> For complete details, see <i>Help > Creating a Project > Loading Image Stacks and Movies</i>.</p><p><p>For an example pipeline using TrackObjects, see the CellProfiler  <a href="http://www.cellprofiler.org/examples.html#Tracking">Examples</a> webpage.</p><p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <b>Object measurements</b> <ul> <li><i>Label:</i> Each tracked object is assigned a unique identifier (label).  Results of splits or merges are seen as new objects and assigned a new label.</li> <li><i>ParentImageNumber, ParentObjectNumber:</i> The <i>ImageNumber</i> and  <i>ObjectNumber</i> of the parent object in the prior frame. For a split, each child object will have the label of the object it split from. For a merge, the child will have the label of the closest parent.</li> <li><i>TrajectoryX, TrajectoryY:</i> The direction of motion (in x and y coordinates) of the  object from the previous frame to the current frame.</li> <li><i>DistanceTraveled:</i> The distance traveled by the object from the  previous frame to the current frame (calculated as the magnitude of  the trajectory vectors).</li> <li><i>Displacement:</i> The shortest distance traveled by the object from its initial starting position to the position in the current frame. That is, it is  the straight-line path between the two points.</li> <li><i>IntegratedDistance:</i> The total distance traveled by the object during the lifetime of the object.</li> <li><i>Linearity:</i> A measure of how linear the object trajectity is during the object lifetime. Calculated as (displacement from initial to final  location)/(integrated object distance). Value is in range of [0,1].</li> <li><i>Lifetime:</i> The number of frames an objects has existed. The lifetime starts at 1 at the frame when an object appears, and is incremented with each frame that the object persists. At the final frame of the image set/movie, the  lifetimes of all remaining objects are output.</li> <li><i>FinalAge:</i> Similar to <i>LifeTime</i> but is only output at the final frame of the object's life (or the movie ends, whichever comes first). At this point,  the final age of the object is output; no values are stored for earlier frames. This is useful if you want to plot a histogram of the object lifetimes; all but the final age can be ignored or filtered out.</li> </ul><p><b>Image measurements</b> <ul> <li><i>LostObjectCount:</i> Number of objects that appear in the previous frame but have no identifiable child in the current frame.</li> <li><i>NewObjectCount:</i> Number of objects that appear in the current frame but have no identifiable parent in the previous frame. </li> <li><i>SplitObjectCount:</i> Number of objects in the current frame that  resulted from a split from a parent object in the previous frame.</li> <li><i>MergedObjectCount:</i> Number of objects in the current frame that  resulted from the merging of child objects in the previous frame.</li> </ul><p>See also: Any of the <b>Measure</b> modules, <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>, <b>Groups</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Choose a tracking method</h4><div>
            When trying to track an object in an image, 
            <b>TrackObjects</b> will search within a maximum 
            specified distance (see the <i>distance within which to search</i> setting)
            of the object's location in the previous image, looking for a "match".
            Objects that match are assigned the same number, or label, throughout the 
            entire movie.
            There are several options for the method used to find a match. Choose 
            among these options based on which is most consistent from frame
            to frame of your movie.
            <ul>
            <li><i>Overlap:</i> Compares the amount of spatial overlap between identified objects in 
            the previous frame with those in the current frame. The object with the
            greatest amount of spatial overlap will be assigned the same number (label). Recommended
            when there is a high degree of overlap of an object from one frame to the next, 
            which is the case for movies with high frame rates relative to object motion.</li>

            <li><i>Distance:</i> Compares the distance between each identified
            object in the previous frame with that of the current frame. The 
            closest objects to each other will be assigned the same number (label).
            Distances are measured from the perimeter of each object. Recommended
            for cases where the objects are not very crowded but where <i>Overlap</i> 
            does not work sufficiently well, which is the case
            for movies with low frame rates relative to object motion.</li>

            <li><i>Measurements:</i> Compares each object in the 
            current frame with objects in the previous frame based on a particular 
            feature you have measured for the objects (for example, a particular intensity or shape measurement that can distinguish nearby objects). The object 
            with the closest-matching measurement will be selected as a match and will be 
            assigned the same number (label). This selection requires that you run the 
            specified <b>Measure</b> module previous to this module in the pipeline so
            that the measurement values can be used to track the objects.</li>
            
            <li><i>LAP:</i> Uses the linear assignment problem (LAP) framework. The
            linear assignment problem (LAP) algorithm (<i>Jaqaman et al., 2008</i>) 
            addresses the challenges of high object density, motion heterogeneity, 
            temporary disappearances, and object merging and splitting. 
            The algorithm first links objects between consecutive frames and then links 
            the resulting partial trajectories into complete trajectories. Both steps are formulated 
            as global combinatorial optimization problems whose solution identifies the overall 
            most likely set of object trajectories throughout a movie.

            Tracks are constructed from an image sequence by detecting objects in each 
            frame and linking objects between consecutive frames as a first step. This step alone
            may result in incompletely tracked objects due to the appearance and disappearance
            of objects, either in reality or apparently because of noise and imaging limitations.
            To correct this, you may apply an optional second step which closes temporal gaps 
            between tracked objects and captures merging and splitting events. This step takes
            place at the end of the analysis run.

            <i>(Used only if Measurements is the tracking method)</i><br>
            Select which type of measurement (category) and which specific feature from the
            <b>Measure</b> module will be used for tracking. Select the feature name from 
            the popup box or see each <b>Measure</b> module's help for the list of
            the features measured by that module. If necessary, you will also be asked 
            to specify additional details such as the 
            image from which the measurements originated or the measurement scale.</div><h4>Maximum pixel distance to consider matches</h4><div>
            Objects in the subsequent frame will be considered potential matches if 
            they are within this distance. To determine a suitable pixel distance, you can look
            at the axis increments on each image (shown in pixel units) or
            use the distance measurement tool. To measure distances in an open image, use the "Measure
length" tool under <i>Tools</i> in the display window menu bar. If you click on an image 
and drag, a line will appear between the two endpoints, and the distance between them shown at the right-most
portion of the bottom panel.</div><h4>Select display option</h4><div>
            The output image can be saved as:

            Select <i>Yes</i> to retain the image showing the tracked objects 
            for later use in the pipeline. For example, a common use is for quality control purposes 
            saving the image with the <b>SaveImages</b> module.
            <p>Please note that if you are using the second phase of the LAP method,
            the final labels are not assigned until <i>after</i> the pipeline has
            completed the analysis run. That means that saving the color-coded image
            will only show the penultimate result and not the final product.</p>.</div><h4>Name the output image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if saving the color-coded image)</i><br>

            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied)</i><br>
            This setting controls how to predict an object's position in
            the next frame, assuming that each object moves randomly with
            a frame-to-frame variance in position that follows a Gaussian
            distribution.<br>
            <ul>
            <li><i>Random:</i> A model in which objects move due to 
            Brownian Motion or a similar process where the variance in position
            differs between objects. Use this model if the objects move with some
            random jitter around a stationary location.</li>
            <li><i>Velocity:</i> A model in which the object moves with
            a velocity. Both velocity and position (after correcting for
            velocity) vary following a Gaussian distribution. Use this model if
            the objects move along a spatial trajectory in some direction over time.</li>
            <li><i>Both:</i> <b>TrackObjects</b> will predict each
            object's position using both models and use the model with the
            lowest penalty to join an object in one frame with one in another. Use this
            option if both models above are applicable over time.

            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied)</i>
            <br>
            <b>TrackObjects</b> will estimate the variance of the error
            between the observed and predicted positions of an object for
            each movement model. It will constrain the search for matching
            objects from one frame to the next to the standard deviation
            of the error times the number of standard
            deviations that you enter here.</div><h4>Search radius limit, in pixel units (Min,Max)</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied)</i><br>
            <b>Care must be taken to adjust the upper limit appropriate to the data.</b><br>
            <b>TrackObjects</b> derives a search radius based on the error
            estimation. Potentially, the module can make an erroneous assignment
            with a large error, leading to a large estimated error for
            the object in the next frame. Conversely, the module can arrive
            at a small estimated error by chance, leading to a maximum radius
            that does not track the object in a subsequent frame. The radius
            limit constrains the maximum radius to reasonable values. 
            
            <p>The lower limit should be set to a radius (in pixels) that is a
            reasonable displacement for any object from one frame to the next.
            The upper limit should be set to the maximum reasonable 
            displacement under any circumstances.</p></div><h4>Run the second phase of the LAP algorithm?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied)</i><br>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to run the second phase of the LAP algorithm
            after processing all images. Select <i>No</i> to omit the
            second phase or to perform the second phase when running the module
            as a data tool.
            <p>Since object tracks may start and end not only because of the true appearance 
            and disappearance of objects, but also because of apparent disappearances due
            to noise and limitations in imaging, you may want to run the second phase 
            which attempts to close temporal gaps between tracked objects and tries to
            capture merging and splitting events.</p>

            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)</i><br>
            This setting assigns a cost to keeping a gap caused
            when an object is missing from one of the frames of a track (the
            alternative to keeping the gap is to bridge it by connecting
            the tracks on either side of the missing frames).
            The cost of bridging a gap is the distance, in pixels, of the 
            displacement of the object between frames.
            <p><i><b>Recommendations:</b></i>
            <ul>
            <li>Set the gap cost higher if tracks from objects in previous
            frames are being erroneously joined, across a gap, to tracks from 
            objects in subsequent frames. </li>
            <li>Set the cost lower if tracks
            are not properly joined due to gaps caused by mis-segmentation.</li>
            </ul></p></div><h4>Split alternative cost</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)</i><br>
            This setting is the cost of keeping two tracks distinct
            when the alternative is to make them into one track that
            splits. A split occurs when an object in one frame is assigned
            to the same track as two objects in a subsequent frame.
            The split cost takes two components into account: 
            <ul>
            <li>The area of the split object relative to the area of
            the resulting objects.</li>
            <li>The displacement of the resulting
            objects relative to the position of the original object.</li>
            </ul>
            The split cost is roughly measured in pixels. The split alternative cost is 
            (conceptually) subtracted from the cost of making the split.
            <p><i><b>Recommendations:</b></i>
            <ul>
            <li>The split cost should be set lower if objects are being split
            that should not be split. </li>
            <li>The split cost should be set higher if objects
            that should be split are not.</li>
            </ul></p></div><h4>Merge alternative cost</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)</i><br>
            This setting is the cost of keeping two tracks
            distinct when the alternative is to merge them into one.
            A merge occurs when two objects in one frame are assigned to
            the same track as a single object in a subsequent frame.
            The merge score takes two components into account:
            <ul>
            <li>The area of the two objects
            to be merged relative to the area of the resulting objects.</li>
            <li>The displacement of the original objects relative to the final
            object. </li>
            </ul>
            The merge cost is measured in pixels. The merge
            alternative cost is (conceptually) subtracted from the
            cost of making the merge.
            <p><i><b>Recommendations:</b></i>
            <ul>
            <li>Set the merge alternative cost lower if objects are being
            merged when they should otherwise be kept separate. </li>
            <li>Set the merge alternative cost
            higher if objects that are not merged should be merged.</li>
            </ul></p></div><h4>Maximum gap displacement, in frames</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)</i><br>
            This setting acts as a filter for unreasonably large
            displacements during the second phase. 
            <p><i><b>Recommendations:</b></i>
            <ul>
            <li>The maximum gap displacement should be set to roughly
            the maximum displacement of an object's center from frame to frame. An object that makes large
            frame-to-frame jumps should have a higher value for this setting than one that only moves slightly.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the LAP algorithm will run more slowly with a higher maximum gap displacement 
            value, since the higher this value, the more objects that must be compared at each step.</li>
            <li>Objects that would have been tracked between successive frames for a lower maximum displacement 
            may not be tracked if the value is set higher.</li>
            </ul></p></div><h4>Maximum split score</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)</i><br>
            This setting acts as a filter for unreasonably large
            split scores. The split score has two components: 
            <ul>
            <li>The area of the initial object relative to the area of the
            two objects resulting from the split.</li>
            <li>The distances between the original and resulting objects. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><i><b>Recommendations:</b></i>
            <ul>
            <li>The LAP algorithm will run more slowly with a maximum split score value. </li>
            <li>Objects that would have been split at a lower maximum split score will not be considered for splitting.</li>
            </ul></p>
            </div><h4>Maximum merge score</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)</i><br>
            This setting acts as a filter for unreasonably large
            merge scores. The merge score has two components: 
            <ul>
            <li>The area of the resulting merged object relative to the area of the
            two objects to be merged.</li>
            <li>The distances between the objects to be merged and the resulting object. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><i><b>Recommendations:</b></i>
            <ul>
            <li>The LAP algorithm will run more slowly with a higher maximum merge score value. </li>
            <li>Objects that would have been merged at a lower maximum merge score will not be considered for merging.</li>
            </ul></p></div><h4>Maximum gap</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the LAP tracking method is applied and the second phase is run)</i><br>
            <b>Care must be taken to adjust this setting appropriate to the data.</b><br>
            This setting controls the maximum number of frames that can
            be skipped when merging a gap caused by an unsegmented object.
            These gaps occur when an image is mis-segmented and identification
            fails to find an object in one or more frames.
            <p><i><b>Recommendations:</b></i>
            <ul>
            <li>Set the maximum gap higher in order to have more chance of correctly recapturing an object after 
            erroneously losing the original for a few frames.</li>
            <li>Set the maximum gap lower to reduce the chance of erroneously connecting to the wrong object after
            correctly losing the original object (e.g., if the cell dies or moves off-screen).</li>
            </ul></p></div><h4>Filter objects by lifetime?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if you want objects to be filtered by their
            lifetime, i.e., total duration in frames. This is useful for
            marking objects which transiently appear and disappear, such
            as the results of a mis-segmentation. <br>
            <p><i><b>Recommendations:</b></i>
            <ul>
            <li>This operation does not actually delete the filtered object, 
            but merely removes its label from the tracked object list;
