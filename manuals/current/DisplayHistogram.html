<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>DisplayHistogram</title></head><body><h1>Module: DisplayHistogram</h1><div><b>Display Histogram </b> plots a histogram of the desired measurement. <hr> A histogram is a plot of tabulated data frequencies (each of which is shown as a bar) created by binning measurement data for a set of objects.  A two-dimensional histogram can be created using the <b>DisplayDensityPlot</b> module.<p><p>The module shows the values generated for the current cycle. However,  this module can also be run as a Data Tool, in which you will first be asked for the output file produced by the analysis run. The resultant plot is  created from all the measurements collected during the run.</p><p>See also <b>DisplayDensityPlot</b>, <b>DisplayScatterPlot</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the object whose measurements will be displayed</h4><div>
            Choose the name of objects identified by some previous 
            module (such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> or 
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>) whose measurements are to be displayed.</div><h4>Select the object measurement to plot</h4><div>
            Choose the object measurement made by a previous 
            module to plot.</div><h4>Number of bins</h4><div>
            Enter the number of equally-spaced bins that you want 
            used on the X-axis.</div><h4>Transform the data prior to plotting along the X-axis?</h4><div>
            The measurement data can be scaled with either a 
            linear scale (<i>No</i>) or a <i>log</i> (base 10) 
            scaling.
            <p>Log scaling is useful when one of the 
            measurements being plotted covers a large range of 
            values; a log scale can bring out features in the 
            measurements that would not easily be seen if the 
            measurement is plotted linearly.<p></div><h4>How should the Y-axis be scaled?</h4><div>
            The Y-axis can be scaled either with either a <i>linear</i> 
            scale or a <i>log</i> (base 10) scaling. 
            <p>Log scaling is useful when one of the 
            measurements being plotted covers a large range of 
            values; a log scale can bring out features in the 
            measurements that would not easily be seen if the 
            measurement is plotted linearly.</p></div><h4>Enter a title for the plot, if desired</h4><div>
            Enter a title for the plot. If you leave this blank,
            the title will default 
            to <i>(cycle N)</i> where <i>N</i> is the current image 
            cycle being executed.</div><h4>Specify min/max bounds for the X-axis?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to specify minimum and maximum values for the 
            plot on the X-axis. This is helpful if an outlier bin skews the
            plot such that the bins of interest are no longer visible.</div></div></body></html>
