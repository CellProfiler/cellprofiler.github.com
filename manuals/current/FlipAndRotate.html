<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>FlipAndRotate</title></head><body><h1>Module: FlipAndRotate</h1><div><b>Flip and rotate</b> flips (mirror image) and/or rotates an image <hr> <h4>Available measurements</h4> <ul> <li><i>Rotation:</i> Angle of rotation for the input image.</li> </ul> </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select method to flip image</h4><div>
            Select how the image is to be flipped.</div><h4>Select method to rotate image</h4><div>
            <ul>
            <li><i>Do not rotate:</i> Leave the image unrotated. This should be used
            if you want to flip the image only.</li>
            <li><i>Enter angle:</i> Provide the numerical angle by which the 
            image should be rotated.</li>
            <li><i>Enter coordinates:</i> Provide the X,Y pixel locations of 
            two points in the image that should be aligned horizontally or 
            vertically.</li> 
            <li><i>Use mouse:</i> CellProfiler will pause so you can select the 
            rotation interactively. When prompted during the analysis run, grab the image by 
            clicking the left mouse button, rotate the image by 
            dragging with the mouse, then release the mouse button. Press the <i>Done</i> button on the image 
            after rotating the image appropriately.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Crop away the rotated edges?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when rotating images)</i> <br> 
            When an image is rotated, there will be black space at the 
            corners/edges; select <i>Yes</i> to crop away the incomplete rows 
            and columns of the image, or select <i>No</i> to leave it as-is.
            <p>This cropping will produce an image that 
            is not exactly the same size as the original, which may affect 
            downstream modules.</p></div><h4>Calculate rotation</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when using "Use mouse" to rotate images)</i> <br> 
            Select the cycle(s) at which the calculation is requested and calculated.
            <ul>
            <li><i>Individually:</i> Determine the amount of rotation for each image
            individually, e.g., for each cycle.</li>
            <li><i>Only Once:</i> Define the rotation only once (on the first image), then
            then apply it to all images.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Select how the specified points should be aligned</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when using "Enter coordinates" to rotate images)</i><br>
            Specify whether you would like the coordinate points that 
            you entered to be horizontally or 
            vertically aligned after the rotation is complete.</div><h4>Enter angle of rotation</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when using "Enter angle" to rotate images)</i> <br> 
            Enter the angle you would like to rotate the image. 
            This setting is in degrees, with positive angles corresponding 
            to counterclockwise and negative as clockwise.</div></div></body></html>
