<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>CorrectIlluminationApply</title></head><body><h1>Module: CorrectIlluminationApply</h1><div><b>Correct Illumination - Apply</b> applies an illumination function, usually created by <b>CorrectIlluminationCalculate</b>, to an image in order to correct for uneven illumination (uneven shading). <hr><p>This module applies a previously created illumination correction function, either loaded by <b>LoadSingleImage</b> or created by <b>CorrectIlluminationCalculate</b>. This module corrects each image in the pipeline using the function specified. <p>See also <b>CorrectIlluminationCalculate</b>.</div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the input image</h4><div>
            Select the image to be corrected.</div><h4>Name the output image</h4><div>
            Enter a name for the corrected image.</div><h4>Select the illumination function</h4><div>
            Select the illumination correction function image that will be used to 
            carry out the correction. This image is usually produced by another module 
            or loaded as a .mat format image using the <b>Images</b> module or 
            <b>LoadSingleImage</b>.</div><h4>Select how the illumination function is applied</h4><div>
            This choice depends on how the illumination function was calculated
            and on your physical model of the way illumination variation affects the 
            background of images relative to the objects in images; it is also somewhat empirical. 
            <ul>
            <li><i>Subtract:</i> Use this option if the background signal is significant 
            relative to the real signal coming from the cells.  If you created the illumination 
            correction function using <i>Background</i>,
            then you will want to choose <i>Subtract</i> here.</li>
            <li><i>Divide:</i> Choose this option if the the signal to background ratio 
            is high (the cells are stained very strongly). If you created the illumination correction 
            function using <i>Regular</i>,
            then you will want to choose <i>Divide</i> here.</li>
            </ul></div></div></body></html>
