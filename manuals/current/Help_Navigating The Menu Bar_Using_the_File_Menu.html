<body><h1>Using the File Menu</h1>
<div>

The <i>File</i> menu provides options for loading and saving your pipelines and 
performing an analysis run.
<ul>
<li><b>New project:</b> Clears the current project by removing all the analysis
modules and resetting the input modules.</li>
<li><b>Open Project...:</b> Open a previously saved CellProfiler project (<i>.cpproj</i> file)
from your hard drive.</li>
<li><b>Open Recent:</b> Displays a list of the most recent projects used. Select any
one of these projects to load it.</li>
<li><b>Save Project:</b> Save the current project to your hard drive as a <i>.cpproj</i> file. 
If it has not been saved previously, you will be asked for a file name to give the 
project. Thereafter, any changes to the project will be automatically saved to that filename unless
you choose <b>Save as...</b>.</li>
<li><b>Save Project As...:</b> Save the project to a new file name.</li>
<li><b>Revert to Saved:</b> Restore the currently open project to the settings it had when
it was first opened.</li>
<li><b>Import Pipeline:</b> Gives you the choice of importing a CellProfiler pipeline file from 
your hard drive (<i>From file...</i>) or from a web address (<i>From URL...</i>). If importing from
a file, you can point it to a pipeline (<i>.cppipe</i>) file or have it extract the pipeline from
a project (<i>.cpproj</i>) file.</li>
<li><b>Export:</b> You have the choice of exporting the pipeline you are currently working on as a 
CellProfiler <i>.cppipe</i> pipeline file (<i>Pipeline</i>), or the image set list as a CSV (<i>Image set listing</i>).</li>
<li><b>Clear Pipeline:</b> Removes all modules from the current pipeline.</li>
<li><b>View Image:</b> Opens a dialog box prompting you to select an image file for
display. Images listed in the File list panel in the <b>Images</b> module can be also be displayed by double-clicking 
on the filename.</li>
<li><b>Analyze Images:</b> Executes the current pipeline using the current pipeline
and Default Input and Output folder settings.</li>
<li><b>Stop Analysis:</b> Stop the current analysis run.</li>
<li><b>Run Multiple Pipelines:</b> Execute multiple pipelines in sequential order. 
This option opens a dialog box allowing you to select the pipelines you would like 
to run, as well as the associated input and output folders. See
the help in the <i>Run Multiple Pipelines</i> dialog for more details.</li>
<li><b>Resume Pipeline:</b> Resume a partially completed analysis run from where it left off.
You will be prompted to choose the output <i>.h5/.mat</i> file 
containing the partially complete measurements and the analysis run will pick up 
starting with the last cycle that was processed. </li>
<li><b>Preferences...:</b> Displays the Preferences window, where you can change 
many options in CellProfiler.</li>
<li><b>Exit:</b></b> End the current CellProfiler session. You will be given the option
of saving your current pipeline if you have not done so.</li>
</ul></div></body>
