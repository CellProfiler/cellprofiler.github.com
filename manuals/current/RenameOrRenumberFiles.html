<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>RenameOrRenumberFiles</title></head><body><h1>Module: RenameOrRenumberFiles</h1><div><b>Rename or Renumber Files</b> renames or renumbers files on the hard drive. <hr> This file-renaming utility adjusts text within image file names.  <i><b>Be very careful with this module because its purpose is  to rename (and overwrite) files!</b></i>  You will have the opportunity to confirm  the name change for the first cycle only. If the folder containing the files  contains subfolders, the subfolders and their contents will also be renamed. The module will not rename the file in test mode, so you should use test mode to ensure that the settings are correct.<p>You can use this module to standardize the number of characters in your file names and to remove unwanted characters from your file names. This is especially useful if you want file names that have numbers in them to appear in numerical order when processed by <b>NamesAndTypes</b>.<br><p>While this module performs basic renaming operations, if you can extract metadata from your images using the <b>Metadata</b> module, you may find using metadata substitution in <b>SaveImages</b> to be more flexible. Please refer to metadata handling for those modules and in Help for more details.<p><h3>Examples</h3><p><p>Renumbering can be useful when numbers within image filenames do not have a minimum number of digits and thus appear out of order when listed in some Unix/Mac OSX systems. For example, on some systems, files would appear like this and thus be measured differently from the expected sequence by CellProfiler:</p> 1DrosophilaDAPI_1.tif<br> 1DrosophilaDAPI_10.tif<br> 1DrosophilaDAPI_2.tif<br> 1DrosophilaDAPI_3.tif<br> 1DrosophilaDAPI_4.tif<br> <p>To renumber the files in the expected order, the numeric digits need to be  padded with zeros to the same length. In this case, you would want to: <ul> <li>Retain 16 characters at the beginning ("1DrosophilaDAPI_").</li> <li>Retain 4 characters at the end (".tif").</li> <li>"Renumber" as the handling method using 3 numerical digits.</li> <li>Set the text addition box to "No".</li> </ul><p><table border = "1"> <tr><td><i>Original name</i></td><td><i>New name</i></td></tr> <tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_1.tif</td>  <td>1DrosophilaDAPI_001.tif</td></tr> <tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_10.tif</td> <td>1DrosophilaDAPI_010.tif</td></tr> <tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_100.tif</td><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_100.tif</td></tr> </table><p><p>Renaming can be useful when file names are too long or have characters that  interfere with other software or file systems. To accomplish the following, you would  want to: <ul> <li>Retain 5 characters at the beginning ("1Dros")</li> <li>Retain 8 characters at the end ("_<3-digit number>.tif", assuming they have already been renumbered)</li> <li>Select "Delete" as the handling method</li> <li>Check the text addition box and enter "DP" as text to place between the retained start and ending strings</li> </ul> <table border = "1"> <tr><td><i>Original name</i></td><td><i>New name</i></td></tr> <tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_001.tif</td> <td>1DrosDP_001.tif</td></tr> <tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_010.tif</td> <td>1DrosDP_010.tif</td></tr> <tr><td>1DrosophilaDAPI_100.tif</td> <td>1DrosDP_100.tif</td></tr> </table><p>See also: <b>NamesAndTypes</b>, <b>SaveImages</b> </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the input image</h4><div>
            Select the images associated with the files
            you want to rename. This should be an image loaded by the
            <b>Input</b> modules.
            Be very careful because you will be renaming these files!</div><h4>Number of characters to retain at start of file name</h4><div>
            Number of characters at the start of the old
            file name that will be copied over verbatim to the new file name. For
            instance, if this setting is "6" and the file name is 
            "Image-734.tif", the output file name will also start with 
            "Image-".</div><h4>Number of characters to retain at the end of file name</h4><div>
            Number of characters at the end of the old
            file name that will be copied over verbatim to the new file name. For
            instance, if this setting is "4" and the file name is
            "Image-734.tif", the output file name will also end with ".tif".</div><h4>Handling of remaining characters</h4><div>
            You can either treat the characters between the start and
            end as numbers or you can delete them. If you treat them as numbers,
            you will be given the opportunity to pad the numbers with zeros
            so that all of your file names will have a uniform length. For
            instance, if you were to renumber the highlighted portion of the
            file "Image-<u>734</u>.tif" using four digits, the result would
            be "Image-0734.tif".</div><h4>Number of digits for numbers</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Renumber is selected)</i><br>
            Use this setting to pad numbers with zeros so that they
            all have a uniform number of characters. For instance, padding
            with four digits has the following result:<br>
            <code><table>
            <tr><th>Original</th><th>Padded</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>0001</td></tr>
            <tr><td>10</td><td>0010</td></tr>
            <tr><td>100</td><td>0100</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1000</td><td>1000</td></tr>
            </table></code></div><h4>Add text to the file name?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if you want to add text
            to the file name. If you had chosen <i>Renumber</i> above,
            the module will add the text after your number.
            If you had chosen <i>Delete</i>, the module will replace
            the deleted text with the text you enter here.</div><h4>Replacement text</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if you chose to add text to the file name)</i><br>
            Enter the text that you want to add to each file name.</div><h4>Replace spaces?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to replace spaces in the final
            version of the file name with some other text. 
            <p>Select <i>No</i> if the file name can have spaces 
            or if none of the file names have spaces.</p></div><h4>Space replacement</h4><div>
            This is the text that will be substituted for spaces
            in your file name.</div></div></body></html>
