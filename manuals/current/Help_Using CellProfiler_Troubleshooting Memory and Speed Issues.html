<p>CellProfiler includes several options for dealing with out-of-memory
errors associated with image analysis: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><i>Resize the input images.</i><br>
If the image is high-resolution, it may be helpful to determine whether the 
features of interest can be processed (and accurate data obtained) by using a 
lower-resolution image. If this is the  case, use the <b>Resize</b> module (in the
<i>Image Processing</i> category) to scale down the image to a more manageable size
and perform the desired operations on the smaller image.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Use the <b>ConserveMemory</b> module.</i><br>                                 
The <b>ConserveMemory</b> module lets you clear the images stored in memory, 
with the exception of any you specify. Please see the 
<b>ConserveMemory</b> module help for more details.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are several options in CellProfiler for speeding up processing: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><i>Run without display windows.</i><br>
Each module is associated with a display window that takes time to render and/or
update. Closing these windows improves speed somewhat. 
To the left of each module listed in your pipeline an icon 
<img src="images\IMG_EYE.png"></img> indicates whether
the module window will be displayed during the analysis run. You can turn off individual module windows by
clicking on the icon; this icon <img src="images\IMG_CLOSED_EYE.png"></img> indicates that the window 
will not be shown. Select <i>Window > Hide all windows on run</i> to prevent display
of all module windows.</p></li>           
                                                                            
<li><p><i>Use care in object identification </i><br>                                   
If you have a large image which contains many small        
objects, a good deal of computer time will be spent processing each   
individual object, many of which you might not need. To avoid this, make 
sure that you adjust the diameter options in <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> to   
exclude small objects in which you are not interested, or use a <b>FilterObjects</b> 
module to eliminate such objects.</p></li>               
</ul>
