<div>

Right-clicking in an image displayed in a window will bring up a pop-up menu with
the following options:
<ul>
<li><i>Open image in new window:</i> Displays the image in a new display window. This is useful 
for getting a closer look at a window subplot that has a small image.</li>
<li><i>Show image histogram:</i> Produces a new window containing a histogram 
of the pixel intensities in the image. This is useful for qualitatively examining
whether a threshold value determined by <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> seems 
reasonable, for example. Image intensities in CellProfiler typically range from
zero (dark) to one (bright).</li>
<li><i>Image contrast:</i> Presents three options for displaying the color/intensity values in 
the images:
<ul>
<li><i>Raw:</i> Shows the image using the full colormap range permissible for the
image type. For example, for a 16-bit image, the pixel data will be shown using 0 as black
and 65535 as white. However, if the actual pixel intensities span only a portion of the
image intensity range, this may render the image unviewable. For example, if a 16-bit image
only contains 12 bits of data, the resultant image will be entirely black.</li>
<li><i>Normalized (default):</i> Shows the image with the colormap "autoscaled" to
the maximum and minimum pixel intensity values; the minimum value is black and the
maximum value is white. </li>
<li><i>Log normalized:</i> Same as <i>Normalized</i> except that the color values
are then log transformed. This is useful for when the pixel intensity spans a wide
range of values but the standard deviation is small (e.g., the majority of the 
interesting information is located at the dim values). Using this option 
increases the effective contrast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Channels:</i> For color images only. You can show any combination of the red, 
green, and blue color channels.</li>
</ul>
