<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>CalculateStatistics</title></head><body><h1>Module: CalculateStatistics</h1><div><b>Calculate Statistics</b> calculates measures of assay quality  (V and Z' factors) and dose response data (EC50) for all measured features made from images. <hr> The V and Z' factors are statistical measures of assay quality and are calculated for each per-image measurement and for each average per-object  measurement that you have made in the pipeline. Placing  this module at the end of a pipeline in order to calculate these values allows  you to identify which measured features are most powerful for distinguishing  positive and negative control samples, or for accurately quantifying the assay's response to dose. These measurements will be calculated for all measured values (Intensity, AreaShape, Texture, etc.). These measurements can be exported as the "Experiment" set of data.<p><h4>Available measurements</h4><p><ul> <li><b>Experiment features:</b> Whereas most CellProfiler measurements are calculated for each object (per-object)  or for each image (per-image), this module produces <i>per-experiment</i> values;  for example, one Z' factor is calculated for each measurement, across the entire analysis run. <ul> <li><i>Zfactor:</i> The Z'-factor indicates how well separated the positive and negative controls are. A Z'-factor &gt; 0 is potentially screenable; a Z'-factor &gt; 0.5 is considered an excellent assay. The formula is 1 &minus 3 &times; (&sigma;<sub>p</sub> + &sigma;<sub>n</sub>)/|&mu;<sub>p</sub> - &mu;<sub>n</sub>|  where &sigma;<sub>p</sub> and &sigma;<sub>n</sub> are the standard deviations of the positive and negative controls,  and &mu;<sub>p</sub> and &mu;<sub>n</sub> are the means of the positive and negative controls.</li> <li><i>Vfactor:</i> The V-factor is a generalization of the Z'-factor, and is  calculated as 1 &minus 6 &times; mean(&sigma;)/|&mu;<sub>p</sub> - &mu;<sub>n</sub>| where &sigma; are the standard deviations of the data, and &mu;<sub>p</sub> and &mu;<sub>n</sub> are defined as above.</li> <li><i>EC50:</i> The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) is the concentration of a treatment required to induce a response which is 50%% of the maximal response.</li> <li><i>OneTailedZfactor:</i> This measure is an attempt to overcome a limitation of  the original Z'-factor formulation (it assumes a Gaussian distribution) and is  informative for populations with moderate or high amounts of skewness. In these  cases, long tails opposite to the mid-range point lead to a high standard deviation  for either population, which results in a low Z' factor even though the population  means and samples between the means may be well-separated. Therefore, the  one-tailed Z' factor is calculated with the same formula but using only those samples that lie  between the positive/negative population means. <b>This is not yet a well established  measure of assay robustness, and should be considered experimental.</b></li> </ul> </li> </ul><p>For both Z' and V factors, the highest possible value (best assay quality) is 1, and they can range into negative values (for assays where distinguishing between positive and negative controls is difficult or impossible). The Z' factor is based only on positive and negative controls. The V factor is based on an entire dose-response curve rather than on the minimum and maximum responses. When there are only two doses in the assay (positive and negative controls only), the V factor will equal the Z' factor.<p><p><i>Note:</i> If the standard deviation of a measured feature is zero for a particular set of samples (e.g., all the positive controls), the Z' and V factors will equal 1 despite the fact that the assay quality is poor.  This can occur when there is only one sample at each dose. This also occurs for some non-informative measured features, like the number of cytoplasm compartments per cell, which is always equal to 1.</p><p><p>This module can create MATLAB scripts that display the EC50 curves for each measurement. These scripts will require MATLAB and the statistics toolbox in order to run.

The first line of this file is a  header that names the items. Each subsequent line represents data for one image cycle, so your file should have the header line plus one line per image to be processed. You can also make a file for <b>LoadData</b> to load that contains the positive/negative control and  dose designations <i>plus</i> the image file names to be processed, which is a good way  to guarantee that images are matched with the correct data. The control and dose information can be designated in one of two ways: <ul> <li>As metadata (so that the column header is prefixed with the "Metadata_" tag). "Metadata" is the category and the name after the underscore is the measurement.</li> <li>As some other type of data, in which case the header needs to be of the form <i>&lt;prefix&gt;_&lt;measurement&gt;</i>. Select <i>&lt;prefix&gt;</i> as  the category and <i>&lt;measurement&gt;</i> as the measurement.</li> </ul> Here is an example file:<br><br> <code> <tt><table> <tr><td>Image_FileName_CY3,</td><td>Image_PathName_CY3,</td><td>Data_Control,</td><td>Data_Dose</td></tr> <tr><td>"Plate1_A01.tif",</td><td>"/images",</td><td>-1,</td><td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>"Plate1_A02.tif",</td><td>"/images",</td><td>1,</td><td>1E10</td></tr> <tr><td>"Plate1_A03.tif",</td><td>"/images",</td><td>0,</td><td>3E4</td></tr> <tr><td>"Plate1_A04.tif",</td><td>"/images",</td><td>0,</td><td>5E5</td></tr> </table></tt> </code> <br><p>See also the <b>Metadata</b> and legacy <b>LoadData</b> modules. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the image measurement describing the positive and negative control status</h4><div>
            The Z' factor, a measure of assay quality, is calculated by this 
            module based on measurements from images that are specified as positive controls 
            and images that are specified as negative controls. (Images that are neither are 
            ignored.) The module assumes that 
            all of the negative controls are specified by a minimum value, all of the
            positive controls are specified by a maximum value, and all other images have an 
            intermediate value; this might allow you to use your dosing information to also 
            specify the positive and negative controls. If you don't use actual dose 
            data to designate your controls, a common practice is to designate -1 as a 
            negative control, 0 as an experimental sample, and 1 as a positive control.  
            In other words, positive controls should all be specified by a single high 
            value (for instance, 1) and negative controls should all be specified by a 
            single low value (for instance, 0). Other samples should have an intermediate value
            to exclude them from the Z' factor analysis.<p>
            The typical way to provide this information in the pipeline is to create 
            a text comma-delimited (CSV) file outside of CellProfiler and then load that file into the pipeline
            using the <b>Metadata</b> module or the legacy <b>LoadData</b> module. In that case, choose the
            measurement that matches the column header of the measurement
            in the input file. See the <b>Metadata</b> module help for an example text file.</div><h4>Select the image measurement describing the treatment dose</h4><div>
            The V and Z' factor, a measure of assay quality, and the EC50, indicating 
            dose/response, are calculated by this module based on each image being 
            specified as a particular treatment dose. Choose a measurement that gives 
            the dose of some treatment for each of your images. <p>

            </div><h4>Log-transform the dose values?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if you have dose-response data and you want to log-transform 
            the dose values before fitting a sigmoid curve.
            <p>Select <i>No</i> if your data values indicate only positive vs. negative 
            controls.</p></div><h4>Create dose/response plots?</h4><div><a name='wants_save_figure'></a>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if you want to create and save 
            dose response plots. You will be asked for information on how to save the plots.</div><h4>Figure prefix</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when creating dose/response plots)</i><br>
            CellProfiler will create a file name by appending the measurement name
            to the prefix you enter here. For instance, if you have objects
            named, "Cells", the "AreaShape_Area measurement", and a prefix of "Dose_",
            CellProfiler will save the figure as <i>Dose_Cells_AreaShape_Area.m</i>.
            Leave this setting blank if you do not want a prefix.</div><h4>Output file location</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when creating dose/response plots)</i><br>
            This setting lets you choose the folder for the output
            files. 
You can choose among the following options which are common to all file input/output 
modules:
<ul>
<li><i>Default Input Folder</i>: Use the default input folder.</li>
<li><i>Default Output Folder:</i> Use from the default output folder.</li>
<li><i>Elsewhere...</i>: Use a particular folder you specify.</li>
<li><i>Default input directory sub-folder</i>: Enter the name of a subfolder of 
the default input folder or a path that starts from the default input folder.</li>
<li><i>Default output directory sub-folder</i>: Enter the name of a subfolder of 
the default output folder or a path that starts from the default output folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Elsewhere</i> and the two sub-folder options all require you to enter an additional 
path name. You can use an <i>absolute path</i> (such as "C:\imagedir\image.tif" on a PC) or a 
<i>relative path</i> to specify the file location relative to a directory):
<ul>
<li>Use one period to represent the current directory. For example, if you choose 
<i>Default Input Folder sub-folder</i>, you can enter "./MyFiles" to look in a 
folder called "MyFiles" that is contained within the Default Input Folder.</li>
<li>Use two periods ".." to move up one folder level. For example, if you choose 
<i>Default Input Folder sub-folder</i>, you can enter "../MyFolder" to look in a 
folder called "MyFolder" at the same level as the Default Input Folder.</li>
</ul></p>

            
            <p>
For <i>Elsewhere...</i>, <i>Default Input Folder sub-folder</i> and 
<i>Default Output Folder sub-folder</i>, if you have metadata associated with your 
images via <b>Metadata</b> module, you can name the folder using metadata
tags. 
You can insert a previously defined metadata tag by either using:
<ul><li>The insert key</li>
<li>A right mouse button click inside the control</li>
<li>In Windows, the Context menu key, which is between the Windows key and Ctrl key </li></ul>
The inserted metadata tag will appear in green. To change a previously inserted metadata tag, 
navigate the cursor to just before the tag and either:
<ul><li>Use the up and down arrows to cycle through possible values.</li>
<li>Right-click on the tag to display and select the available values.</li></ul> 
            For instance, if you have a metadata tag named 
            "Plate", you can create a per-plate folder by selecting one of the subfolder options
            and then specifying the subfolder name as "\g&lt;Plate&gt;". The module will 
            substitute the metadata values for the current image set for any metadata tags in the 
            folder name. Please see the <b>Metadata</b> module for more details on metadata collection and usage.</p></div></div></body></html>
