Each color's brightness can be adjusted independently by using  relative weights.<p><p>See also <b>ColorToGray</b>.</div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select a color scheme</h4><div>
            This module can use one of two color schemes to combine images:<br/>
            <ul><li><i>RGB</i>: Each input image determines the intensity of
            one of the color channels: red, green, and blue.</li>
            <li><i>CMYK</i>: Three of the input images are combined to determine
            the colors (cyan, magenta, and yellow) and a fourth is used only for brightness. The cyan
            image adds equally to the green and blue intensities. The magenta
            image adds equally to the red and blue intensities. The yellow
            image adds equally to the red and green intensities.</li>
            <li><i>Stack</i>: The channels are stacked in order. An arbitrary number of 
            channels is allowed.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Relative weight for the red image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if RGB is selected as the color scheme)</i><br>
            Enter the relative weight for the red image. If all relative weights are equal, all three 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative to each other, 
            increase or decrease the relative weights.</div><h4>Relative weight for the green image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if RGB is selected as the color scheme)</i><br>
            Enter the relative weight for the green image. If all relative weights are equal, all three 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative to each other, 
            increase or decrease the relative weights.</div><h4>Relative weight for the blue image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if RGB is selected as the color scheme)</i><br>
            Enter the relative weight for the blue image. If all relative weights are equal, all three 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative to each other, 
            increase or decrease the relative weights.</div><h4>Relative weight for the cyan image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if CMYK is selected as the color scheme)</i><br>
            Enter the relative weight for the cyan image. If all relative weights are equal, all 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative to each other, 
            increase or decrease the relative weights.</div><h4>Relative weight for the magenta image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if CMYK is selected as the color scheme)</i><br>
            Enter the relative weight for the magenta image. If all relative weights are equal, all 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative to each other, 
            increase or decrease the relative weights.</div><h4>Relative weight for the yellow image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if CMYK is selected as the color scheme)</i><br>
            Enter the relative weight for the yellow image. If all relative weights are equal, all 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative to each other, 
            increase or decrease the relative weights.</div><h4>Relative weight for the brightness image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if CMYK is selected as the color scheme)</i><br>
            Enter the relative weight for the brightness image. If all relative weights are equal, all 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative to each other, 
            increase or decrease the relative weights.</div></div></body></html>
