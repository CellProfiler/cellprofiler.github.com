<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>ReassignObjectNumbers</title></head><body><h1>Module: ReassignObjectNumbers</h1><div><b>Reassign Object Numbers</b> renumbers previously identified objects. <hr> Objects and their measurements are associated  with each other based on their object numbers (also known as <i>labels</i>). Typically, each object is assigned a single unique number, such that the exported measurements are ordered by this numbering.  This module allows the reassignment of object numbers by either unifying separate objects to share the same label, or splitting portions of separate objects that previously had the same label.<p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <b>Parent object measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Children Count:</i> The number of relabeled objects created from each parent object.</li> </ul><p><b>Reassigned object measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Parent:</i>The label number of the parent object.</li> <li><i>Location_X, Location_Y:</i> The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center of  mass of the reassigned objects.</li> </ul><p><h4>Technical notes</h4> Reassignment means that the numerical value of every pixel within  an object (in the label matrix version of the image) gets changed, as specified by  the module settings. In order to ensure that objects are labeled consecutively  without gaps in the numbering (which other modules may depend on),  <b>ReassignObjectNumbers</b> will typically result in most of the objects having  their numbers reordered. This reassignment information is stored as a per-object measurement  with both the original input and reasigned output objects, in case you need to track the  reassignment.<p><p>See also <b>RelateObjects</b>.</p> </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the input objects</h4><div>
            Select the objects whose object numbers you want to reassign.
            You can use any objects that were created in previous modules, such as 
            <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> or <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>.</div><h4>Name the new objects</h4><div>
            Enter a name for the objects whose numbers have been reassigned.
            You can use this name in subsequent modules that take objects as inputs.</div><h4>Operation</h4><div>
            You can choose one of the following options:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Unify:</i> Assign adjacent or nearby objects the same
            label based on certain criteria. It can be useful, for example, 
            to merge together touching objects that were incorrectly split into two pieces 
            by an <b>Identify</b> module.</li>
            <li><i>Split:</i> Assign a unique number to separate objects
            that currently share the same label. This can occur if you applied certain 
            operations with the <b>Morph</b> module to objects.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Maximum distance within which to unify objects</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only with the Unify option and the Distance method)</i><br>
            Objects that are less than or equal to the distance
            you enter here, in pixels, will be unified. If you choose zero 
            (the default), only objects that are touching will be unified. 
            Note that <i>Unify </i> will not actually connect or bridge
            the two objects by adding any new pixels; it simply assigns the same object number
            to the portions of the object. The new, unified object
            may therefore consist of two or more unconnected components.</div><h4>Unify using a grayscale image?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only with the Unify option)</i><br>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to use the objects' intensity features to determine whether two
            objects should be unified. If you choose to use a grayscale image,
            <i>Unify</i> will unify two objects only if they
            are within the distance you have specified <i>and</i> certain criteria about the objects
            within the grayscale image are met.</div><h4>Select the grayscale image to guide unification</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if a grayscale image is to be used as a guide for unification)</i><br>
            Select the name of an image loaded or created by a previous module.</div><h4>Minimum intensity fraction</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if a grayscale image is to be used as a guide for unification)</i><br>
            Select the minimum acceptable intensity fraction. This will be used 
            as described for the method you choose in the next setting.</div><h4>Method to find object intensity</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if a grayscale image is to be used as a guide for unification)</i><br>
            You can use one of two methods to determine whether two
            objects should unified, assuming they meet the distance criteria (as specified above):
            <ul>
            <li><i>Centroids:</i> When the module considers merging two objects, 
            this method identifies the centroid of each object, 
            records the intensity value of the dimmer of the two centroids, 
            multiplies this value by the <i>minimum intensity fraction</i> to generate a threshold,
            and draws a line between the centroids. The method will unify the 
            two objects only if the intensity of every point along the line is above 
            the threshold. For instance, if the intensity
            of one centroid is 0.75 and the other is 0.50 and the <i>minimum intensity fraction</i>
            has been chosen to be 0.9, all points along the line would need to have an intensity
            of min(0.75, 0.50) * 0.9 = 0.50 * 0.9 = 0.45.<br>
            This method works well for round cells whose maximum intensity
            is in the center of the cell: a single cell that was incorrectly segmented 
            into two objects will typically not have a dim line between the centroids 
            of the two halves and will be correctly unified.</li>
            
            <li><i>Closest point:</i> This method is useful for unifying irregularly shaped cells 
            which are connected. It starts by assigning background pixels in the vicinity of the objects to the nearest
            object. Objects are then unified if each object has background pixels that are:
            <ul>
            <li>Within a distance threshold from each object;</li>
            <li>Above the minimum intensity fraction of the nearest object pixel;</li>
            <li>Adjacent to background pixels assigned to a neighboring object.</li>
            </ul>
            An example of a feature that satisfies the above constraints is a line of
            pixels that connect two neighboring objects and is roughly the same intensity 
            as the boundary pixels of both (such as an axon connecting two neurons).</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Retain outlines of the relabeled objects?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to retain the outlines of the new objects 
for later use in the pipeline. For example, a common use is for quality control purposes by 
overlaying them on your image of choice using the <b>OverlayOutlines</b> module and then saving 
the overlay image with the <b>SaveImages</b> module.</div><h4>Name the outlines</h4><div>
            
<i>(Used only if the outline image is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i> <br>
Enter a name for the outlines of the identified 
objects. The outlined image can be selected in downstream modules by selecting 
them from any drop-down image list.</div><h4>Unification method</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only with the Unify option)</i><br>
            You can unify objects in one of two ways:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Distance: </i> All objects within a certain pixel radius 
            from each other will be unified</li>
            <li><i>Per-parent: </i>All objects which share the same parent 
            relationship to another object will be unified. This is not be confused
            with using the <b>RelateObjects</b> module, in which the related objects
            remain as individual objects. See <b>RelateObjects</b> for more details.</li>
            </ul>
            </div><h4>Select the parent object</h4><div>
            Select the parent object that will be used to
            unify the child objects. Please note the following:
            <ul>
            <li>You must have established a parent-child relationship
            between the objects using a prior <b>RelateObjects</b> module.</li>
            <li>Primary objects and their associated secondary objects are
            already in a one-to-one parent-child relationship, so it makes no
            sense to unify them here.</li>
            </ul></div></div></body></html>
