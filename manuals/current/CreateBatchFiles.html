<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>CreateBatchFiles</title></head><body><h1>Module: CreateBatchFiles</h1><div><b>Create Batch Files</b> produces files that allow individual batches of images to be processed separately on a cluster of computers. <hr> This module creates files that can be submitted in parallel to a cluster for faster processing. It should be placed at the end of an image processing pipeline.<p><p>If your computer mounts the file system differently than the cluster computers, <b>CreateBatchFiles</b> can replace the necessary parts of the paths to the  image and output files. For instance, a Windows machine might  access files images by mounting the file system using a drive letter, like this:<br><br> <tt>Z:\your_data\images</tt><br><br> and the cluster computers access the same file system like this:<br><br> <tt>/server_name/your_name/your_data/images</tt><br><br> In this case, the local root path is <tt>Z:\your_data\images</tt> and the cluster  root path is <tt>/server_name/your_name/your_data/images</tt>. </p><p>For more details on batch processing, please see <i>Help > Other Features > Batch Processing</i>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Store batch files in default output folder?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to store batch files in the Default Output folder. <br>
            Select <i>No</i> to enter the path to the folder that will be used to store
            these files.</div><h4>Output folder path</h4><div>
            Enter the path to the output folder.</div><h4>Are the cluster computers running Windows?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if the cluster computers are running one of the Microsoft
            Windows operating systems. In this case, <b>CreateBatchFiles</b> will
            modify all paths to use the Windows file separator (backslash &#92;). <br>
            Select <i>No</i> for <b>CreateBatchFiles</b> to modify all paths to use
            the Unix or Macintosh file separator (slash &#47;).</div><h4>Local root path</h4><div>
                        Enter the path to files on this computer.
                        This is the root path on the local machine (i.e., the computer setting up
                        the batch files). If <b>CreateBatchFiles</b> finds
                        any pathname that matches the local root path at the begining, it will replace the
                        start with the cluster root path.
                        <p>For example, if you have mapped the remote cluster machine like this:<br><br>
                        <tt>Z:\your_data\images</tt> (on a Windows machine, for instance)<br><br>
                        and the cluster machine sees the same folder like this:<br><br>
                        <tt>/server_name/your_name/your_data/images</tt><br><br>
                        you would enter <tt>Z:</tt> here and <t>/server_name/your_name/</tt> 
                        for the cluster path in the next setting.</div><h4>Cluster root path</h4><div>
                        Enter the path to files on the cluster. This is the cluster 
                        root path, i.e., how the cluster machine sees the
                        top-most folder where your input/output files are stored.
                        <p>For example, if you have mapped the remote cluster machine like this:<br><br>
                        <tt>Z:\your_data\images</tt> (on a Windows machine, for instance)<br><br>
                        and the cluster machine sees the same folder like this:<br><br>
                        <tt>/server_name/your_name/your_data/images</tt><br><br>
                        you would enter <tt>Z:</tt> in the previous setting for the
                        local machine path and <t>/server_name/your_name/</tt> here. </div></div></body></html>
