<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>NamesAndTypes</title></head><body><h1>Module: NamesAndTypes</h1><div> The <b>NamesAndTypes</b> module gives images and/or channels a meaningful name to a particular image or channel, as well as defining the relationships between images to create an image set. <hr> Once the relevant images have been identified using the <b>Images</b> module (and/or has had metadata associated with the images using the <b>Metadata</b> module), the <b>NamesAndTypes</b> module  gives each image a meaningful name by which modules in the analysis pipeline will refer to it. <p><h4>What is an "image set"?</h4> An <i>image set</i> is the collection of channels that represent a single field of view. For example, a fluorescent assay may have samples using DAPI and GFP to label separate  cellular sub-compartments (see figure below), and for each site imaged, one DAPI (left) and one GFP image (right)  is acquired by the microscope. Sometimes, the two channels are combined into a single color images and other  times they are stored as two separate grayscale images, as in the figure. <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="4" width="100%"> <tr> <td align="right"><img src="images\dapi.png"></td> <td align="left"><img src="images\gfp.png"></td> </tr> </table> For the purposes of analysis, you want the DAPI and GFP image for a given site to be loaded and processed  together. Therefore, the DAPI and GFP image for a given site comprise an image set for that site. <p><h4>What do I need as input?</h4> The <b>NamesAndTypes</b> module receives the file list produced by the <b>Images</b> module. If you used the <b>Metadata</b> module to attach metadata to the images, this information is also received by  <b>NamesAndTypes</b> and available for its use.<p><h4>What do the settings mean?</h4> In the above example, the <b>NamesAndTypes</b> module allows you to assign each of these channels a unique name, provided by you. All files of a given channel will be referred to by the chosen name within the pipeline,  and the data exported by the pipeline will also be labeled according to this name. This simplifies the  bookkeeping of your pipeline and results by making the input and output data more intuitive: a large  number of images are referred to by a small collection of names, which are hopefully easier for you  to recognize.<p><p>The most common way to perform this assignment is by specifying the pattern in the filename which the channel(s) of interest have in common. This is done using user-defined rules in a similar manner  to that of the <b>Images</b> module; other attributes of the file may also be used. If you have multiple channels, you then assign the relationship between channels.  For example, in the case mentioned above, the DAPI and GFP images are named in such a way that it  is apparent to the researcher which is which, e.g., "_w1" is contained in the file for the DAPI images,  and "_w1" in the file name for the GFP images.</p><p><p>You can also use <b>NamesAndTypes</b> to define the relationships between images. For example,  if you have acquired multiple wavelengths for your assay, you will need to match the channels to each other for each field of view so that they are loaded and processed together.  This can be done by using their  associated metadata. If you would like to use the metadata-specific settings, please see the <b>Metadata</b> module  or <i>Help > General help > Using Metadata in CellProfiler</i> for more details on metadata usage  and syntax. </p><p><h4>What do I get as output?</h4> The <b>NamesAndTypes</b> module is the last of the required input modules. After this module, you can choose   any of the names you defined from a drop-down list in any downstream analysis module which requires an  image as input. If you defined a set of objects using this module, those names are also available for analysis modules that require an object as input.<p><p>In order to see whether the images are matched up correctly to form the image sets you would expect, press  the "Update" button below the divider to display a table of results using the current settings. Each row  corresponds to a unique image set, and the columns correspond to the name you specified for CellProfiler  to identify the channel. You can press this button as many times as needed to display the most current image  sets obtained. When you complete your pipeline and perform an analysis run, CellProfiler will process the  image sets in the order shown.</p> <table cellpadding="0" width="100%"> <tr align="center"><td><img src="images\NamesAndTypes_ExampleDisplayTable.png"></td></tr> </table><p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <ul>  <li><i>FileName, PathName:</i> The prefixes of the filename and location, respectively, of each image set  written to the per-image table.</li> <li><i>ObjectFileName, ObjectPathName:</i> (For used for images loaded as objects) The prefixes of the  filename and location, respectively, of each object set written to the per-image table.</li> </ul> </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Assign a name to</h4><div>
            This setting allows the user to specify a name to images or subsets
            of images so they can be treated separately by downstream modules. 
            For example, giving a different name to a GFP stain image and a 
            brightfield image of the same site allows each to be processed 
            independently.
            <p>There are three choices:<br>
            <ul><li><i>All images</i>: Give every image the same name.
            This is the simplest choice and the appropriate one if you have
            only one kind of image (or only one image). CellProfiler will
            give each image the same name and the pipeline will load only
            one of the images per iteration.</li>
            <li><i>Images matching rules</i>: Give images one of several names
            depending on the file name, directory and metadata. This is the
            appropriate choice if more than one image was acquired from each 
            imaging site. You will be asked for distinctive criteria for
            each image and will be able to assign each category of image
            a name that can be referred to in downstream modules.</li>
            </ul></p>
            </div><h4>Image set matching method</h4><div>
            Select how you want to match the image from one channel with
            the images from other channels.
            <p>This setting controls how CellProfiler picks which images
            should be matched together when analyzing all of the images
            from one site. </p>
            <p>You can match corresponding channels to each other in one of two ways:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Order</i>: CellProfiler will order the images in
            each channel alphabetically by their file path name and, for movies
            or TIF stacks, will order the frames by their order in the file.
            CellProfiler will then match the first from one channel to the
            first from another channel. <br>
            This approach is sufficient for most applications, but
            will match the wrong images if any of the files are missing or misnamed.
            The image set list will then get truncated according to the channel with
            the fewer number of files.</li>
            
            <li><i>Metadata</i>: CellProfiler will match files with
            the same metadata values. This option is more complex to use than 
            <i>Order</i> but is more flexible and less prone to inadvertent
            errors. Please see the <b>Metadata</b> module for more details on metadata collection and usage. 
            <p>As an example, an experiment is run on a single multiwell plate with two 
            image channels (OrigBlue, <i>w1</i> and OrigGreen, <i>w2</i>) containing
            well and site metadata extracted using the <b>Metadata</b> module. A set of
            images from two sites in well A01 might be described using the following:
            <table border="1" align="center">
            <tr><th><b>File name</b></th><th><b>Well</b></th><th><b>Site</b></th><th><b>Wavelength</b></th></tr>
            <tr><td>P-12345_<font color="#ce5f33">A01</font>_<font color="#3dce33">s1</font>_<font color="#33bbce">w1</font>.tif</td><td><font color="#ce5f33">A01</font></td><td><font color="#3dce33">s1</font></td><td><font color="#33bbce">w1</font></td></tr>
            <tr><td>P-12345_<font color="#ce5f33">A01</font>_<font color="#3dce33">s1</font>_<font color="#33bbce">w2</font>.tif</td><td><font color="#ce5f33">A01</font></td><td><font color="#3dce33">s1</font></td><td><font color="#33bbce">w2</font></td></tr>
            <tr><td>P-12345_<font color="#ce5f33">A01</font>_<font color="#3dce33">s2</font>_<font color="#33bbce">w1</font>.tif</td><td><font color="#ce5f33">A01</font></td><td><font color="#3dce33">s2</font></td><td><font color="#33bbce">w1</font></td></tr>
            <tr><td>P-12345_<font color="#ce5f33">A01</font>_<font color="#3dce33">s2</font>_<font color="#33bbce">w2</font>.tif</td><td><font color="#ce5f33">A01</font></td><td><font color="#3dce33">s2</font></td><td><font color="#33bbce">w2</font></td></tr>
            </table>
            </p>
            <p>We want to match the channels so that each field of view in uniquely represented by the two channels. In this case, 
            to match the <i>w1</i> and <i>w2</i> channels with their respective well and site metadata,
            you would select the <i>Well</i> metadata for both channels, followed by the <i>Site</i> metadata
            for both channels. In other words:
            <table border="1" align="center">
            <tr><th><b>OrigBlue</b></th><th><b>OrigGreen</b></th></tr>
            <tr><td>Well</td><td>Well</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Site</td><td>Site</td></tr>
            </table>
            In this way, CellProfiler will match up files that have the same
            well and site metadata combination, so that the <i>w1</i> channel belonging to well A01 and site 1 
            will be paired with the <i>w2</i> channel belonging to well A01 and site 1. This will occur for all
            unique well and site pairings, to create an image set similar to the following:
            <table border="1" align="center">
            <tr><th colspan="2"><b>Image set tags</b></th><th colspan="2"><b>Channels</b></th></tr>
            <tr><td><b>Well</b></td><td><b>Site</b></td><td><b>OrigBlue (w1)</b></td><td><b>OrigGreen (w2)</b></td></tr>
            <tr><td><font color="#ce5f33">A01</font></td><td><font color="#3dce33">s1</font></td><td>P-12345_<font color="#ce5f33">A01</font>_<font color="#3dce33">s1</font>_<font color="#33bbce">w1</font>.tif</td><td>P-12345_<font color="#ce5f33">A01</font>_<font color="#3dce33">s1</font>_<font color="#33bbce">w2</font>.tif</td></tr>
            <tr><td><font color="#ce5f33">A01</font></td><td><font color="#3dce33">s2</font></td><td>P-12345_<font color="#ce5f33">A01</font>_<font color="#3dce33">s2</font>_<font color="#33bbce">w1</font>.tif</td><td>P-12345_<font color="#ce5f33">A01</font>_<font color="#3dce33">s2</font>_<font color="#33bbce">w2</font>.tif</td></tr>
            </table>
            Image sets for which a given metadata value combination (e.g., well, site) is either
            missing or duplicated for a given channel will simply be omitted.</p>
            <p>In addition, CellProfiler can match a single file for one channel against many files from
            another channel. This is useful, for instance, for applying an illumination correction file
            for an entire plate against every image file for that plate. In this instance, this would be 
            done by selecting <i>Plate</i> as the common metadata tag and <i>(None)</i> for the rest:
            <table border="1" align="center">
            <tr><th><b>OrigBlue</b></th><th><b>IllumBlue</b></th></tr>
            <tr><td>Plate</td><td>Plate</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Well</td><td>(None)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Site</td><td>(None)</td></tr>
            </table>
            </p>
            <p>There are two special cases in metadata handling worth mentioning:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Missing metadata:</i> For a particular metadata tag, one image from a given
            image set has metadata values defined but another image does not. An example is when a microscope
            aborts acquisition prematurely in the middle of scanning two channels for a site, and captures 
            one channel but not the other. In this case, plate, well and site metadata value exists for one
            image but not for the other since it was never acquired. </li>
            <li><i>Duplicate metadata:</i> For a particular metadata tag, the same metadata values exist
            for multiple image sets such that they are not uniquely defined. An example is when a microscope
            re-scans a site in order to recover from a prior error. In this case, there may be one image from
            one channel but <i>two</i> images for the other channel, for the same site. Therefore, multiple instances
            of the same plate, well and site metadata values exist for the same image set.</li>
            </ul> 
            In both of these cases, the exact pairing between channels no longer exists. For missing metadata, the pairing is one-to-none,
            and for duplicate metadata, the pairing is one-to-two. In these instances where a match cannot be
            made, <b>NamesAndTypes</b> will simply omit the confounding metadata values from consideration. In the above
            example, an image set will not be created for the plate, well and site combination in question. 
            </p>
            </li>
            </ul></div><h4>Set intensity range from</h4><div>
This option determines how the image intensity should be 
rescaled from 0.0 &ndash; 1.0.
<ul>
<li><i>Image metadata:</i> Rescale the image 
intensity so that saturated values are rescaled to 1.0 by dividing 
all pixels in the image by the maximum possible intensity value
allowed by the imaging hardware. Some image formats save the maximum 
possible intensity value along with the pixel data.
For instance, a microscope might acquire images using a 12-bit
A/D converter which outputs intensity values between zero and 4095,
but stores the values in a field that can take values up to 65535.
Choosing this setting ensures that the intensity scaling value is 
the maximum allowed by the hardware, and not the maximum allowable
by the file format. </li>
<li><i>Image bit-depth:</i> Ignore the image 
metadata and rescale the image to 0 &ndash; 1 by dividing by 255 
or 65535, depending on the number of bits used to store the image.</li>
</ul>
Please note that CellProfiler does not provide the option of loading
the image as the raw, unscaled values. If you wish to make measurements
on the unscaled image, use the <b>ImageMath</b> module to multiply the 
scaled image by the actual image bit-depth.</div><h4>Select the rule criteria</h4><div>
            Specify a filter using rules to narrow down the files to be analyzed. 
            <p>
Clicking the rule menus shows you all the file <i>attributes</i>, <i>operators</i> and <i>conditions</i> you can specify to narrow down 
the image list.
<ol>
<li>For each rule, first select the <i>attribute</i> that the rule is to be based on. For example, you can select "File" 
to define a rule that will filter files on the basis of their filename. </li>
<li>The <i>operator</i> drop-down is then updated with operators applicable to the attribute you selected. For example, if you select 
"File" as the attribute, the operator
menu includes text operators such as <i>Contain</i> or <i>Starts with</i>. On the other hand, if you
select "Extension" as the attribute, you can choose the logical operators "Is" or "Is not" from the menu.</li>
<li>In the operator drop-down menu, select the operator you want to use. For example,
if you want to match data exactly, you may want the "Exactly match" or the "Is" operator. If you want the
condition to be more loose, select an operator such as "Contains".</li>
<li>Use the <i>condition</i> box to type the condition you want to match. The more
you type, the more specific the condition is. 
<ul>
<li>As an example, if you create a new filter and select
<i>File</i> as the attribute, then select "Does" and "Contain" as the operators, and type "Channel" as the condition,
the filter finds all files that include the text "Channel", such as "Channel1.tif" "Channel2.jpg", "1-Channel-A01.BMP" and so on.</li>
<li>If you select "Does" and "Start with" as the operators and "Channel1" in the Condition box, 
the rule will includes such files as "Channel1.tif" "Channel1-A01.png", and so on.</li></ul>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr align="center"><td><img src="images\Images_UsingRules.png"></td></tr>
</table>
</li>
You can also create regular expressions (an advanced syntax for pattern matching; see <a href="#regexp">below</a>) in order to select particular files.
</ol>
<p>To add another rule, click the plus  buttons to the right of each rule. Subtract an existing rule by clicking the 
minus button.</p>
<p>You can also link a set of rules by choosing the logical expression <i>All</i> or <i>Any</i>. If you use  
<i>All</i> logical expression, all the rules be true for a file to be included in the File list. If
you use the <i>Any</i> option, only one of the conditions has to be met for a file to be included.</p>
<p>If you want to create more complex rules (e.g, some criteria matching all rules and others matching any),
you can create sets of rules, by clicking the ellipsis button (to the right of the plus button). 
Repeat the above steps to add more rules to the filter until you have
all the conditions you want to include.</p>

<a name="regexp"><h5>Details on regular expressions</h5></a>
<p>A <i>regular expression</i> is a general term refering to a method of searching for pattern matches in text. There is a high
learning curve to using them, but are quite powerful once you understand the basics.</p>
<p>
Patterns are specified using
combinations of metacharacters and literal characters. There are a few
classes of metacharacters, partially listed below. Some helpful links follow:

</ul>

<p>The following metacharacters match exactly one character from its respective set of characters:<br><br>
<table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#555555"><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Metacharacter</b></font></th><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Meaning</b></font></th></tr>
<tr><td>.</td><td>Any character</td></tr>
<tr><td>[]</td><td>Any character contained within the brackets</td></tr>
<tr><td>[^]</td><td>Any character not contained within the brackets</td></tr>
<tr><td>\w</td><td>A word character [a-z_A-Z0-9]</td></tr>
<tr><td>\W</td><td>Not a word character [^a-z_A-Z0-9]</td></tr>
<tr><td>\d</td><td>A digit [0-9]</td></tr>
<tr><td>\D</td><td>Not a digit [^0-9]</td></tr>
<tr><td>\s</td><td>Whitespace [ \t\r\n\f\v]</td></tr>
<tr><td>\S</td><td>Not whitespace [^ \t\r\n\f\v]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The following metacharacters are used to logically group subexpressions
or to specify context for a position in the match. These metacharacters
do not match any characters in the string:<br><br>
<table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#555555"><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Metacharacter</b></font></th><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Meaning</b></font></th></tr>
<tr><td>( )</td><td>Group subexpression</td></tr>
<tr><td>|</td><td>Match subexpression before or after the |</td></tr>
<tr><td>^</td><td>Match expression at the start of string</td></tr>
<tr><td>$</td><td>Match expression at the end of string</td></tr>
<tr><td>\&lt;</td><td>Match expression at the start of a word</td></tr>
<tr><td>\&gt;</td><td>Match expression at the end of a word</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The following metacharacters specify the number of times the previous
metacharacter or grouped subexpression may be matched:<br><br>
<table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#555555"><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Metacharacter</b></font></th><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Meaning</b></font></th></tr>
<tr><td>*</td><td>Match zero or more occurrences</td></tr>
<tr><td>+</td><td>Match one or more occurrences</td></tr>
<tr><td>?</td><td>Match zero or one occurrence</td></tr>
<tr><td>{n,m}</td><td>Match between n and m occurrences</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Characters that are not special metacharacters are all treated literally
in a match. To match a character that is a special metacharacter, escape
that character with a '\'. For example '.' matches any character, so to
match a '.' specifically, use '\.' in your pattern.

Examples:
<ul>
<li><code>[trm]ail</code> matches 'tail' or 'rail' or 'mail'.</li>
<li><code>[0-9]</code> matches any digit between 0 to 9.</li>
<li><code>[^Q-S]</code> matches any character other than 'Q' or 'R' or 'S'.</li>
<li><code>[[]A-Z]</code> matches any upper case alphabet along with square brackets.</li>
<li><code>[ag-i-9]</code> matches characters 'a' or 'g' or 'h' or 'i' or '-' or '9'.</li>
<li><code>[a-p]*</code> matches '' or 'a' or 'aab' or 'p' etc.</li>
<li><code>[a-p]+</code> matches  'a' or 'abc' or 'p' etc.</li>
<li><code>[^0-9]</code> matches any string that is not a number.</li>
<li><code>^[0-9]*$</code> matches either a blank string or a natural number.</li>
<li><code>^-[0-9]+$|^\+?[0-9]+$</code> matches any integer.</li>
</ul>

</p></div><h4>Name to assign these images</h4><div>
            Enter the name that you want to call this image.
            After this point, this image will be referred to by this
            name, and can be selected from any drop-down menu that
            requests an image selection.</div><h4>Name to assign these objects</h4><div>
            Enter the name that you want to call this set of objects.
            After this point, this object will be referred to by this
            name, and can be selected from any drop-down menu that
            requests an object selection.</div><h4>Select the image type</h4><div>
    You can specify how these images should be treated:
    <ul>
    <li><i>Grayscale image:</i> An image in which each pixel 
    represents a single intensity value. Most of the modules in CellProfiler
    operate on images of this type. <br>
    If this option is applied to a color image, the red, green and blue 
    pixel intensities will be averaged to produce a single intensity value.</li>
    <li><i>Color image:</i> An image in which each pixel
    repesents a red, green and blue (RGB) triplet of intensity values.
    Please note that the object detection modules such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>
    expect a grayscale image, so if you want to identify objects, you
    should use the <b>ColorToGray</b> module in the analysis pipeline
    to split the color image into its component channels.<br>
    You can use the <i>Grayscale image</i> option to collapse the
    color channels to a single grayscale value if you don't need CellProfiler
    to treat the image as color.</li>
    <li><i>Binary mask:</i> A <i>mask</i> is an image where some of the 
    pixel intensity values are zero, and others are non-zero. The most common
    use for a mask is to exclude particular image regions from consideration. By 
    applying a mask to another image, the portion of the image that overlaps with
    the non-zero regions of the mask are included. Those that overlap with the 
    zeroed region are "hidden" and not included in downstream calculations.
    For this option, the input image should be a binary image, i.e, foreground is 
    white, background is black. The module will convert any nonzero values 
    to 1, if needed. You can use this option to load a foreground/background 
    segmentation produced by one of the <b>Identify</b> modules.</li>
    <li><i>Illumination function:</i> An <i>illumination correction function</i>
    is an image which has been generated for the purpose of correcting uneven 
    illumination/lighting/shading or to reduce uneven background in images. Typically,
    is a file in the MATLAB .mat format. See <b>CorrectIlluminationCalculate</b> and 
    <b>CorrectIlluminationApply</b> for more details. </li>
    <li><i>Objects:</i> Use this option if the input image 
    is a label matrix and you want to obtain the objects that it defines. 
    A label matrix is a grayscale or color image in which the connected 
    regions share the same label, which defines how objects are represented 
    in CellProfiler. The labels are integer values greater than or equal 
    to 0. The elements equal to 0 are the background, whereas the elements 
    equal to 1 make up one object, the elements equal to 2 make up a second 
    object, and so on. This option allows you to use the objects 
    immediately without needing to insert an <b>Identify</b> module to 
    extract them first. See <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> for more details. <br>
    This option can load objects created by the <b>SaveImages</b> module. These objects 
    can take two forms, with different considerations for each:
    <ul>
    <li><i>Non-overalapping</i> objects are stored as a label matrix. This matrix should be 
    saved as grayscale, rather than color.</li>
    <li><i>Overlapping objects</i> are stored in a multi-frame TIF, each frame of whichc consists of a 
    grayscale label matrix. The frames are constructed so that objects that overlap are placed
    in different frames.</li> 
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
    </div><h4>Retain outlines of loaded objects?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to retain the outlines of the new objects 
for later use in the pipeline. For example, a common use is for quality control purposes by 
overlaying them on your image of choice using the <b>OverlayOutlines</b> module and then saving 
the overlay image with the <b>SaveImages</b> module.</div><h4>Name the outline image</h4><div>
<i>(Used only if the outline image is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i> <br>
Enter a name for the outlines of the identified 
objects. The outlined image can be selected in downstream modules by selecting 
them from any drop-down image list.</div></div></body></html>
