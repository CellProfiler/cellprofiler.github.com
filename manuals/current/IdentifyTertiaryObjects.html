<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>IdentifyTertiaryObjects</title></head><body><h1>Module: IdentifyTertiaryObjects</h1><div><b>Identify Tertiary Objects</b> identifies tertiary objects (e.g., cytoplasm) by removing smaller primary objects (e.g. nuclei) from larger secondary objects (e.g., cells), leaving a ring shape. <hr> <h4>What is a tertiary object?</h4> In CellProfiler, we use the term <i>object</i> as a generic term to refer to an identifed feature in an image, usually a cellular subcompartment of some kind (for example, nuclei, cells, colonies, worms).  We define an object as <i>tertiary</i> when it is identified by using a prior primary and  secondary objects for reference. A common use case is when nuclei have been found using <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> and the cell body has been found using <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>  but measurements from the cytoplasm, the region outside the nucleus but within the cell body,  are desired. This module may be used to define the cytoplasm as an new object.<p><h4>What do I need as input?</h4> This module will take the smaller identified objects and remove them from the larger identified objects. For example, "subtracting" the nuclei from the cells will leave just the cytoplasm, the properties of which can then be measured by downstream <b>Measure</b> modules. The larger objects should therefore be equal in size or larger than the smaller objects and must completely contain the smaller objects; <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b> will produce objects that satisfy this constraint. Ideally, both inputs should be objects produced by prior <b>Identify</b> modules.<p><h4>What do I get as output?</h4> A set of tertiary objects are produced by this module, which can be used in  downstream modules for measurement purposes or other operations. Because each  tertiary object is produced from primary and secondary objects, there will  always be at most one secondary object for each primary object. See the section <a href="#Available_measurements">"Available measurements"</a> below for  the measurements that are produced by this module.<p><p>Note that creating subregions using this module can result in objects with  a single label that nonetheless are not contiguous. This may lead to unexpected results when running measurment modules such as <b>MeasureObjectSizeShape</b>  because calculations of the perimeter, aspect ratio, solidity, etc. typically make sense only for contiguous objects. Other modules, such as <b>MeasureImageIntensity</b> and  <b>MeasureTexture</b> modules, are not affected and will yield expected results.<p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <b>Image measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Count:</i> The number of tertiary objects identified.</li> </ul><p><b>Object measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Parent:</i> The identity of the primary object and secondary object associated  with each tertiary object.</li> <li><i>Location_X, Location_Y:</i> The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center of mass of the  identified tertiary objects.</li> </ul><p>See also <b>IdentifyPrimaryObject</b> and <b>IdentifySecondaryObject</b> modules. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the larger identified objects</h4><div>
            Select the larger identified objects. This will usually
            be an object previously identified by a <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>
            module.</div><h4>Select the smaller identified objects</h4><div>
            Select the smaller identified objects. This will usually
            be an object previously identified by a <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>
            module.</div><h4>Name the tertiary objects to be identified</h4><div>
            Enter a name for the new tertiary objects. The tertiary objects 
            will consist of the smaller object subtracted from the larger object.</div><h4>Name the outline image</h4><div>
            
<i>(Used only if the outline image is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i> <br>
Enter a name for the outlines of the identified 
objects. The outlined image can be selected in downstream modules by selecting 
them from any drop-down image list.</div><h4>Retain outlines of the tertiary objects?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to retain the outlines of the new objects 
for later use in the pipeline. For example, a common use is for quality control purposes by 
overlaying them on your image of choice using the <b>OverlayOutlines</b> module and then saving 
the overlay image with the <b>SaveImages</b> module.</div><h4>Shrink smaller object prior to subtraction?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to shrink the smaller object by 1 pixel before subtracting the objects.
            this approach will ensure that there is always a tertiary object produced, even if it is
            only 1 pixel wide.
            <p>Select <i>No</i> to subtract the objects directly, which will ensure that no pixels
            are shared between the primary/secondary/tertiary objects and hence measurements for all
            three sets of objects will not use the same pixels multiple times. However, this may result 
            in the creation of objects with no area. Measurements can still be made on such objects, but
            the results will be zero or not-a-number (NaN)</p></div></div></body></html>
