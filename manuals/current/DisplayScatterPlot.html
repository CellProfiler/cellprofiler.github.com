If there are too many data points on the plot, you should consider  using <b>DisplayDensityPlot</b> instead.<p><p>The module will show a plot shows the values generated for the current cycle. However,  this module can also be run as a Data Tool, in which you will first be asked for the output file produced by the analysis run. The resultant plot is  created from all the measurements collected during the run.</p><p>See also <b>DisplayDensityPlot</b>, <b>DisplayHistogram</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Type of measurement to plot on X-axis</h4><div>
            You can plot two types of measurements:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Image:</i> For a per-image measurement, one numerical value is 
            recorded for each image analyzed.
            Per-image measurements are produced by
            many modules. Many have <b>MeasureImage</b> in the name but others do not
            (e.g., the number of objects in each image is a per-image 
            measurement made by the <b>IdentifyObject</b> 
            modules).</li>
            <li><i>Object:</i> For a per-object measurement, each identified 
            object is measured, so there may be none or many 
            numerical values recorded for each image analyzed. These are usually produced by
            modules with <b>MeasureObject</b> in the name.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Select the object to plot on the X-axis</h4><div><i>(Used only when plotting objects)</i><br>
            Choose the name of objects identified by some previous 
            module (such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> or 
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>) whose measurements are to be displayed on the X-axis.</div><h4>Select the measurement to plot on the X-axis</h4><div>
            Choose the measurement (made by a previous 
            module) to plot on the X-axis.</div><h4>Type of measurement to plot on Y-axis</h4><div>
            You can plot two types of measurements:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Image:</i> For a per-image measurement, one numerical value is 
            recorded for each image analyzed.
            Per-image measurements are produced by
            many modules. Many have <b>MeasureImage</b> in the name but others do not
            (e.g., the number of objects in each image is a per-image 
            measurement made by <b>IdentifyObject</b> 
            modules).</li>
            <li><i>Object:</i> For a per-object measurement, each identified 
            object is measured, so there may be none or many 
            numerical values recorded for each image analyzed. These are usually produced by
            modules with <b>MeasureObject</b> in the name.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Select the object to plot on the Y-axis</h4><div><i>(Used only when plotting objects)</i><br>
            Choose the name of objects identified by some previous 
            module (such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> or 
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>) whose measurements are to be displayed on the Y-axis.</div><h4>Select the measurement to plot on the Y-axis</h4><div>
            Choose the measurement (made by a previous 
            module) to plot on the Y-axis.</div><h4>How should the X-axis be scaled?</h4><div>
            The X-axis can be scaled with either a <i>linear</i> 
            scale or a <i>log</i> (base 10) scaling. 
            <p>Log scaling is useful when one of the 
            measurements being plotted covers a large range of 
            values; a log scale can bring out features in the 
            measurements that would not easily be seen if the 
            measurement is plotted linearly.</p></div><h4>How should the Y-axis be scaled?</h4><div>

            Enter a title for the plot. If you leave this blank,
            the title will default 
            to <i>(cycle N)</i> where <i>N</i> is the current image 
            cycle being executed.</div></div></body></html>
