<body><h1>Using Metadata In CellProfiler</h1>
<div>

Metadata (i.e., additional data about image data) is sometimes available for input images.
This information can be:
<ol>
<li>Used by CellProfiler to group images with common metadata identifiers (or "tags") 
together for particular steps in a pipeline;</li>
<li>Stored in the output file along with CellProfiler-measured features for
annotation or sample-tracking purposes;
<li>Used to name additional input/output files.</li></ol></p>
<p>Two sources of metadata are:
<ul>
<li><i>Metadata provided in the image filename or location (pathname).</i> For example, images produced by an automated
microscope can be given names similar to "Experiment1_A01_w1_s1.tif" in which the metadata about the
plate ("Experiment1"), the well ("A01"), the wavelength number ("w1") and the imaging site ("s1") are encapsulated. The
name of the folder in which the images are saved may be meaningful and may also be considered metadata as well.
If this is the case for your data, use <b>LoadImages</b> to extract this information for
use in the pipeline and storage in the output file.</li>
<li><i>Metadata provided as a table of information</i>. Often, information associated with each image (such as
treatment, plate, well, etc) is available as a separate spreadsheet. If this is the case for your data, use 
<b>LoadData</b> to load this information.</li>
</ul>
Details for the metadata-specific help is given next to the appropriate settings in 
<b>LoadImages</b> and <b>LoadData</b>, as well the specific settings in other modules which
can make use of metadata. However, here is an overview of how metadata is obtained and used.

<h3>Associating images with metadata</h3>

<p>In <b>LoadImages</b>, metadata can be extracted from the filename and/or folder 
location using regular expression, a specialized syntax used for text pattern-matching.
These regular expressions can be used to identify different parts of the filename / folder. 
The syntax <i>(?P&lt;fieldname&gt;expr)</i> will extract whatever matches <i>expr</i> and 
assign it to the image's <i>fieldname</i> measurement. A regular expression tool is available 
which will allow you to check the accuracy of your regular expression.</p>

<p>For instance, say a researcher has folder names with the date and subfolders containing the
images with the run ID (e.g., <i>./2009_10_02/1234/</i>). 
The following regular expression will capture the plate, well and site in the fields 
<i>Date</i> and <i>Run</i>:<br>
<table border = "1">
<tr><td colspan = "2">.*[\\/](?P&lt;Date&gt;.*)[\\/](?P&lt;Run&gt;.*)$ </td></tr>
<tr><td>.*[\\/]</td><td>Skip characters at the beginning of the pathname until either a slash (/) or
backslash (\) is encountered (depending on the OS). The extra slash for the backslash is used as
an escape sequence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>(?P&lt;Date&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Date</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>.*</td><td>Capture as many characters that follow</td></tr>
<tr><td>[\\/]</td><td>Discard the slash/backslash character</td></tr>
<tr><td>(?P&lt;Run&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Run</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>.*</td><td>Capture as many characters as follow</td></tr>
<tr><td>$</td><td>The <i>Run</i> field must be at the end of the path string, i.e. the
last folder on the path. This also means that the <i>Date</i> field contains the parent
folder of the <i>Date</i> folder.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In <b>LoadData</b>, metadata is extracted from a CSV (comma-separated) file 
(a spreadsheet). Columns whose name begins with "Metadata" can be used to group 
files loaded by <b>LoadData</b> that are associated with a common metadata value.
The files thus grouped together are then processed as a distinct image set.</p>

<p>For instance, an experiment might require that images created on the same day 
use an illumination correction function calculated from all images from that day, 
and furthermore, that the date be captured in the file names for the individual image 
sets and in a .csv file specifying the illumination correction functions. </p>

<p>In this case, if the illumination correction images are loaded with the 
<b>LoadData</b> module, the file should have a "Metadata_Date" 
column which contains the date identifiers. Similarly, if the individual images 
are loaded using the <b>LoadImages</b> module, <b>LoadImages</b> should be set to extract the 
<Date> metadata field from the file names. The pipeline will then match the individual 
images with their corresponding illumination correction functions based on matching 
"Metadata_Date" fields.</p>
<h3>Use of metadata-specific module settings</h3>

<p>Once the metadata has been obtained, you can use <i>metadata tags</i> to reference them
in later modules. 
You can insert a previously defined metadata tag by either using:
<ul><li>The insert key</li>
<li>A right mouse button click inside the control</li>
<li>In Windows, the Context menu key, which is between the Windows key and Ctrl key </li></ul>
The inserted metadata tag will appear in green. To change a previously inserted metadata tag, navigate the cursor to just before the tag and either:
<ul><li>Use the up and down arrows to cycle through possible values.</li>
<li>Right-click on the tag to display and select the available values.</li></ul> Several modules are capable of 
using metadata tags for various purposes. Examples include:
<ul>
<li>You would like to create and apply an illumination correction function to all images from a particular
plate. You can use metadata tags to save each illumination correction function with a plate-specific
name in <b>SaveImages</b>, and then use <b>LoadSingleImage</b> to get files
with the name associated with your image's plate to be applied to your original images.</li>
<li>You have a set of experiments for which you would like to produce and save results
individually for each experiment but using only one analysis run. You can use metadata tags
in <b>ExportToSpreadsheet</b> or <b>ExportToDatabase</b> to save a spreadsheet for each experiment in 
a folder named according to the experiment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, the pre-defined metadata tag is used to name a file or folder. Tags are case-sensitive; 
the name must match the metadata field defined by <b>LoadImages</b> or <b>LoadData</b>. The options
for the setting will specify whether tags are applicable; see the module setting help for additional
information on how to use them in the context of the specific module.</p>
