<body><h1>Configuring Logging</h1>
<div>

<br>CellProfiler prints diagnostic messages to the console by default. You
can change this behavior for most messages by configuring logging. The simplest
way to do this is to use the command-line switch, "-L", to set the log level.
For instance, to show error messages or more critical events, start CellProfiler
like this:
<br>
<code>CellProfiler -L ERROR</code>
<br>
The following is a list of log levels that can be used:
<ul>
<li><b>DEBUG:</b> Detailed diagnostic information</li>
<li><b>INFO:</b> Informational messages that confirm normal progress</li>
<li><b>WARNING:</b> Messages that report problems that might need attention</li>
<li><b>ERROR:</b> Messages that report unrecoverable errors that result in data loss or termination of the current operation.</li>
<li><b>CRITICAL:</b> Messages indicating that CellProfiler should be restarted or is incapable of running.</li></ul>
<br>
You can tailor CellProfiler's logging with much more control using a logging
configuration file. You specify the file name in place of the log level on
the command line, like this:
<br>
<code>CellProfiler -L ~/CellProfiler/my_log_config.cfg</code>
</br>
Files are in the Microsoft .ini format which is grouped into categories enclosed
in square brackets and the key/value pairs for each category.
Here is an example file:
<div><pre>
[loggers]
keys=root,pipelinestatistics

[handlers]
keys=console,logfile

[formatters]
keys=detailed

[logger_root]
level=WARNING
handlers=console

[logger_pipelinestatistics]
level=INFO
handlers=logfile
qualname=pipelineStatistics
propagate=0

[handler_console]
class=StreamHandler
formatter=detailed
level=WARNING
args=(sys.stderr)

[handler_logfile]
class=FileHandler
level=INFO
args=('~/CellProfiler/logfile.log','w')

[formatter_detailed]
format=[%(asctime)s] %(name)s %(levelname)s %(message)s
datefmt=
</pre></div>
The above file would print warnings and errors to the console for all messages
but "pipeline statistics" which are configured using the <i>pipelineStatistics</i>
logger are written to a file instead.. The pipelineStatistics logger is the 
logger that is used to print progress messages when the pipeline is run. You
can find out which loggers are being used to write particular messages by
printing all messages with a formatter that prints the logger name ("%(name)s").
