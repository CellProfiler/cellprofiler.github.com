All channels can be merged into one grayscale image (<i>Combine</i>), or each channel  can be extracted into a separate grayscale image (<i>Split</i>). If you use <i>Combine</i>,  the relative weights will adjust the contribution of the colors relative to each other.<br> <br> <i>Note:</i>All <b>Identify</b> modules require grayscale images. <p>See also <b>GrayToColor</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Conversion method</h4><div>
            How do you want to convert the color image? 
            <ul>
            <li><i>Split:</i> Splits the three channels
            (red, green, blue) of a color image into three separate grayscale images. </li>
            <li><i>Combine</i> Converts a color image to a grayscale 
            image by combining the three channels (red, green, blue) together.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Image type</h4><div>
            Many images contain color channels other than red, green
            and blue. For instance, GIF and PNG formats can have an alpha
            channel that encodes transparency. TIF formats can have an arbitrary
            number of channels which represent pixel measurements made by
            different detectors, filters or lighting conditions. This setting
            provides three options to choose from:
            <ul>
            <li><i>RGB:</i> The RGB (red,green,blue) color space is the typical model in which color images are stored. Choosing this option
            will split the image into any of the red, green and blue component images.</li>
            <li><i>HSV:</i>The HSV (hue, saturation, value) color space is based on more intuitive color characteristics as 
            tint, shade and tone. Choosing
            this option will split the image into any of the hue, saturation, and value component images.</li>
            <li><i>Channels:</i>This is a more complex model for images which involve more than three chnnels.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Relative weight of the red channel</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when combining channels)</i><br>
            Relative weights: If all relative weights are equal, all three 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative 
            to each other, increase or decrease the relative weights.</div><h4>Relative weight of the green channel</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when combining channels)</i><br>
            Relative weights: If all relative weights are equal, all three 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative 
            to each other, increase or decrease the relative weights.</div><h4>Relative weight of the blue channel</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when combining channels)</i><br>
            Relative weights: If all relative weights are equal, all three 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative 
            to each other, increase or decrease the relative weights.</div><h4>Channel number</h4><div>
            This setting chooses a channel to be processed.
            <i>Red: 1</i> is the first channel in a .TIF or the red channel
            in a traditional image file. <i>Green: 2</i> and <i>Blue: 3</i>
            are the second and third channels of a TIF or the green and blue
            channels in other formats. <i>Alpha: 4</i> is the transparency
            channel for image formats that support transparency and is
            channel # 4 for a .TIF file.
            
            <b>ColorToGray</b> will fail to process an image if you select
            a channel that is not supported by that image, for example, "5"
            for a .PNG file</div><h4>Relative weight of the channel</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when combining channels)</i><br>
            Relative weights: If all relative weights are equal, all three 
            colors contribute equally in the final image. To weight colors relative 
            to each other, increase or decrease the relative weights.</div><h4>Image name</h4><div>
            This is the name of the grayscale image that holds
            the image data from the chosen channel.</div></div>
