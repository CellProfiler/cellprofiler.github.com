<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>DisplayDensityPlot</title></head><body><h1>Module: DisplayDensityPlot</h1><div><b>Display Density Plot </b> plots measurements as a two-dimensional density plot. <hr> A density plot displays the relationship between two measurements (that is, features) but instead of showing each data point as a dot, as in a scatter plot, the data points are binned into an equally-spaced  grid of points, where the color of each point in the grid represents the tabulated frequency  of the measurements within that region of the grid. A density plot is also known as a 2-D histogram; in a conventional histogram the height of a bar indicates how many data points fall in that region. By contrast, in a density plot (2-D histogram), the color of a portion of the plot indicates the number of data points in that region. <p><p>The module shows the values generated for the current cycle. However,  this module can also be run as a Data Tool, in which case you will first be asked for the output file produced by the analysis run. The resultings plot is  created from all the measurements collected during the run.</p><p>See also <b>DisplayScatterPlot</b>, <b>DisplayHistogram</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the object to display on the X-axis</h4><div>
            Choose the name of objects identified by some previous 
            module (such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> or 
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>) whose measurements are to be displayed on the X-axis.</div><h4>Select the object measurement to plot on the X-axis</h4><div>
            Choose the object measurement made by a previous 
            module to display on the X-axis.</div><h4>Select the object to display on the Y-axis</h4><div> 
            Choose the name of objects identified by some previous 
            module (such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> or 
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>) whose measurements are to be displayed on the Y-axis.</div><h4>Select the object measurement to plot on the Y-axis</h4><div>
            Choose the object measurement made by a previous 
            module to display on the Y-axis.</div><h4>Select the grid size</h4><div>
            Enter the number of grid regions you want used on each
            axis. Increasing the number of grid regions increases the
            resolution of the plot.</div><h4>How should the X-axis be scaled?</h4><div>
            The X-axis can be scaled either with a <i>linear</i> 
            scale or with a <i>log</i> (base 10) scaling. 
            <p>Using a log scaling is useful when one of the 
            measurements being plotted covers a large range of 
            values; a log scale can bring out features in the 
            measurements that would not easily be seen if the 
            measurement is plotted linearly.</p></div><h4>How should the Y-axis be scaled?</h4><div>

            Select the color map for the density plot. See

            this page</a> for pictures of the available colormaps.</div><h4>Enter a title for the plot, if desired</h4><div>
            Enter a title for the plot. If you leave this blank,
            the title will default 
            to <i>(cycle N)</i> where <i>N</i> is the current image 
            cycle being executed.</div></div></body></html>
