<body><h1>Introduction to Projects</h1>
<div>

<h3>What is a project?</h3>
<p>In CellProfiler, a <i>project</i> is comprised of two elements:
<ul>
<li>An <i>image file list</i> which is the list of files and their locations that are selected by the user as 
candidates for analysis.</li>
<li>The <i>pipeline</i>, which is a series of modules put together used to analyze a set of images.</li>
<li>Optionally, the associated information about the images (<i>metadata</i>). This 
information may be part of the images themselves, or imported externally by the user.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The project is the container for image information associated with a CellProfiler analysis. It stores
such details as: 
<ul>
<li>What type of image(s) are the input files?</li>
<li>Where are the input images located?</li>
<li>What distinguishes multiple image channels from each other? How are these relationships 
represented?</li>
<li>What information about the images and/or experiment is linked to the images, and how?</li>
<li>Are certain groups of images to be processed differently from other groups?</li>
</ul>
By using projects, the above information is stored along with the analysis pipeline and is
available on demand. </p>

<h3>Working with projects</h3>
<h4>Creating a project</h4>
<p>Upon starting CellProfiler, you will be presented with a new, blank project.
At this point, you may start building your project by using the modules located in the "Input
modules" panel on the upper-left. The modules are:
<ul>
<li><b>Images</b>: Assemble the relevant images for analysis (required).</li>
<li><b>Metadata</b>: Asociate metadata with the images (optional).</li>
<li><b>NamesAndTypes</b>: Assign names to channels and define their relationship (required).</li>
<li><b>Groups</b>: Define sub-divisions between groups of images for processing (optional).</li>
</ul>
Detailed help for each module is provided by selecting the module and clicking the "?" button on 
the bottom of CellProfiler.</p>

<h4>Saving a project</h4>
<p>As you work in CellProfiler, the project is updated automatically, so there is no need to
save it unless you are saving the project to a new name or location. You can always save your 
current work to a new project file by selecting <i>File > Save Project As...</i>, which will
save your project, complete with the current image file list and pipeline, to a file with 
with the extension <i>.cpproj</i>.</p>
<p>For those interested, some technical details:
<ul>
<li>The <i>.cpproj</i> file stores collected information using the HDF5 format. Documentation on
how measurements are stored and handled in CellProfiler using this format can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler/wiki/Module-Structure-and-Data-Storage-Retrieval#hdf5-measurement-and-workspace-format">here</a>.</li>
<li>All information is cached in the project file after it is computed. It is either
re-computed or retrieved from the cache when an analysis run is started, when 
entering Test mode, or when the user requests a refreshed view of the information
(e.g., when a setting has been changed).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Legacy modules: LoadImages and LoadData</h4>
<p>Historically, two modules were used for project creation: <b>LoadImages</b> and <b>LoadData</b>.
While the approach described above partly supercedes these modules, you have the option
of preserving these modules if you load old pipelines into CellProfiler that contain them;
these pipelines will operate exactly as before.</p>
<p>Alternately, the user can choose to convert these 
modules into the project equivalent as closely as possible. Both <b>LoadImages</b> and <b>LoadData</b>
remain accessible via the "Add module" and <img src="images\module_add.png">&nbsp;
buttons at the bottom of the pipeline panel.</p>
