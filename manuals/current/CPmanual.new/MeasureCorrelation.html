<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>MeasureCorrelation</title></head><body><h1>Module: MeasureCorrelation</h1><div><b>Measure Correlation</b> measures the correlation between intensities in different images (e.g., different color channels) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, within identified objects or across an entire image. <hr> Given two or more images, this module calculates the correlation between the pixel intensities. The correlation can be measured for entire images, or a correlation measurement can be made within each individual object.<p>Correlations will be calculated between all pairs of images that are selected in  the module, as well as between selected objects. For example, if correlations  are to be measured for a set of red, green, and blue images containing identified nuclei,  measurements will be made between the following: <ul> <li>The blue and green, red and green, and red and blue images. </li> <li>The nuclei in each of the above image pairs.</li> </ul><p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <ul> <li><i>Correlation coefficient:</i> The correlation between a pair of images <i>I</i> and <i>J</i>.  Calculated as Pearson's correlation coefficient, for which the formula is covariance(<i>I</i> ,<i>J</i>)/[std(<i>I</i> ) &times; std(<i>J</i>)].</li> <li><i>Slope:</i> The slope of the least-squares regression between a pair of images I and J. Calculated using the model <i>A</i> &times; <i>I</i> + <i>B</i> = <i>J</i>, w here <i>A</i> is the slope.</li> </ul><p></div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select an image to measure</h4><div>
            Select an image to measure the correlation from.</div><h4>Select where to measure correlation</h4><div>
            You can measure the correlation in several ways: 
            <ul>
            <li><i>Within objects:</i> Measure correlation only in those pixels previously
            identified as an object. You will be asked to specify which object to measure from.</li>
            <li><i>Across entire image:</i> Measure the correlation across all pixels in the images.</li>
            <li><i>Both:</i> Calculate both measurements above.</li>
            </ul>
            All methods measure correlation on a pixel by pixel basis.</div><h4>Select an object to measure</h4><div>
