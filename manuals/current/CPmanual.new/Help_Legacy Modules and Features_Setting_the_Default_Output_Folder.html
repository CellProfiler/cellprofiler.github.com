<body><h1>Setting the Default Output Folder</h1>
<div>

<p>Please note that the Default Output Folder will be deprecated in the future. The location
of files written by the various output modules will be set to an absolute path 
in future versions of CellProfiler.</p>

<p>The <i>Default Output Folder</i> is accessible by pressing the "View output settings"
button at the botton of the pipeline panel. The Default Output Folder is the folder that CellProfiler uses to
store the output file it creates. Also, several File Processing modules (e.g., <b>SaveImages</b> or 
<b>ExportToSpreadsheet</b>) provide the option of saving analysis results to 
this folder on a default basis unless you specify, within the module, an alternate, 
specific folder on your computer. Within modules, we recommend selecting the 
Default Output Folder as much as possible, so that your pipeline will 
work even if you transfer your images and pipeline to a different 
computer. If, instead, you type specific folder path names into a module's settings, 
your pipeline will not work on someone else's computer until you adjust those
pathnames within each module.</p>

<p>Use the <i>Browse</i> button (to the right of the text box) to specify 
the folder you would like to use as the Default Output Folder, or
type the full folder path in the edit box. If you type a folder path that  
cannot be found, the message box below will indicate this fact until you correct the
problem. If you want to specify a folder that does not yet exist, type the desired name and 
click on the <i>New folder</i> icon to the right of the <i>Browse folder</i> icon.
The folder will be created according to the pathname you have typed.</p></div></body>
