<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>SendEmail</title></head><body><h1>Module: SendEmail</h1><div><b>SendEmail</b> send emails to a specified address at desired stages of the analysis run. <hr> This module sends email about the current progress of the image processing. You can specify how often emails are sent out (for example, after the first cycle, after the last cycle, after every <i>N</i> cycles, after <i>N</i> cycles). This module should be placed at the point in the pipeline when you want the emails to be sent. If email sending fails for any reason, a warning message will appear but processing will continue regardless.</div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Sender address</h4><div>
            Enter the address for the email's "From" field.</div><h4>Subject line</h4><div>
            Enter the text for the email's subject line. If you have metadata 
            associated with your images, you can use metadata tags here. 
You can insert a previously defined metadata tag by either using:
<ul><li>The insert key</li>
<li>A right mouse button click inside the control</li>
<li>In Windows, the Context menu key, which is between the Windows key and Ctrl key </li></ul>
The inserted metadata tag will appear in green. To change a previously inserted metadata tag, 
navigate the cursor to just before the tag and either:
<ul><li>Use the up and down arrows to cycle through possible values.</li>
<li>Right-click on the tag to display and select the available values.</li></ul><br>
            For instance, if you have plate metadata,
            you might use the line, "CellProfiler: processing plate " and insert the metadata tag
            for the plate at the end. Please see the <b>Metadata</b> module for more details on metadata collection and usage.</div><h4>Server name</h4><div>
            Enter the address of your SMTP server. You can ask your
            network administrator for your outgoing mail server which is often
            made up of part of your email address, e.g., 
            "Something@university.org". You might be able to find this information
            by checking your settings or preferences in whatever email program
            you use.</div><h4>Port</h4><div>
            Enter your server's SMTP port. The default (25) is the
            port used by most SMTP servers. Your network administrator may
            have set up SMTP to use a different port; also, the connection
            security settings may require a different port.</div><h4>Select connection security</h4><div>
            Select the connection security. Your network administrator 
            can tell you which setting is appropriate, or you can check the
            settings on your favorite email program.</div><h4>Username and password required to login?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if you need to enter a username and password 
            to authenticate.</div><h4>Username</h4><div>
            Enter your server's SMTP username.</div><h4>Password</h4><div>
            Enter your server's SMTP password.</div><h4>Recipient address</h4><div>
            Enter the address to which the messages will be sent.</div><h4>When should the email be sent?</h4><div>
            Select the kind of event that causes
            <b>SendEmail</b> to send an email. You have the following choices:
            <ul>
            <li><i>After first cycle:</i> Send an email during
            processing of the first image cycle.</li>
            <li><i>After last cycle:</i> Send an email after all processing
            is complete.</li>
            <li><i>After group start:</i> Send an email during the first
            cycle of each group of images.</li>
            <li><i>After group end:</i> Send an email after all processing
            for a group is complete.</li>
            <li><i>Every # of cycles</i> Send an email each time a certain
            number of image cycles have been processed. You will be prompted
            for the number of image cycles if you select this choice.</li>
            <li><i>After cycle #:</i> Send an email after the given number
            of image cycles have been processed. You will be prompted for
            the image cycle number if you select this choice. You can add
            more events if you want emails after more than one image cycle.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Image cycle number</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if sending email after a particular cycle number)</i><br>
            Send an email during processing of the given image cycle.
            For instance, if you enter 4, then <b>SendEmail</b>
            will send an email during processing of the fourth image cycle.</div><h4>Image cycle count</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if sending email after every N cycles)</i><br>
            Send an email each time this number of image cycles have
            been processed. For instance, if you enter 4,
            then <b>SendEmail</b> will send an email during processing of
            the fourth, eighth, twelfth, etc. image cycles.</div><h4>Message text</h4><div>
            The body of the message sent from CellProfiler.
            Your message can include metadata values. For instance,
            if you group by plate and want to send an email after processing each
            plate, you could use the message  
            "Finished processing plate \g&lt;Plate&gt;". </div></div></body></html>
