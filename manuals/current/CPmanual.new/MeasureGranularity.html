<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>MeasureGranularity</title></head><body><h1>Module: MeasureGranularity</h1><div><b>Measure Granularity</b> outputs spectra of size measurements  of the textures in the image. <hr> Image granularity is a texture measurement that tries a series of structure elements  of increasing size and outputs a spectrum of measures of how well these structure  elements fit in the texture of the image. Granularity is measured as described by  Ilya Ravkin (references below). The size of the starting structure element as well  as the range of the spectrum is given as input. <p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <ul> <li><i>Granularity:</i> The module returns one measurement for each instance of the granularity spectrum.</li> </ul><p><h4>References</h4> <ul> <li>Serra J.

            If the textures of 
            interest are larger than a few pixels, we recommend you subsample the image with a factor 
            &lt;1 to speed up the processing. Down sampling the image will let you detect larger 
            structures with a smaller sized structure element. A factor &gt;1 might increase the accuracy 
            but also require more processing time. Images are typically of higher resolution than is 
            required for granularity measurements, so the default value is 0.25. For low-resolution images, 
            increase the subsampling fraction; for high-resolution images, decrease the subsampling 
            fraction. Subsampling by 1/4 reduces computation time by (1/4)<sup>3</sup> because the size
            of the image is (1/4)<sup>2</sup> of original and the range of granular spectrum can
            be 1/4 of original. Moreover, the results are sometimes actually a little better
            with subsampling, which is probably because with subsampling the
            individual granular spectrum components can be used as features, whereas
            without subsampling a feature should be a sum of several adjacent
            granular spectrum components. The recommendation on the numerical value
            cannot be determined in advance; an analysis as in this reference may be
            required before running the whole set.

            It is important to 
            remove low frequency image background variations as they will affect the final granularity 
            measurement. Any method can be used as a pre-processing step prior to this module; 
            we have chosen to simply subtract a highly open image. To do it quickly, we subsample the image 
            first. The subsampling factor for background reduction is usually [0.125 &ndash; 0.25].  This is 
            highly empirical, but a small factor should be used if the structures of interest are large. The 
            significance of background removal in the context of granulometry is that image 
            volume at certain granular size is normalized by total image volume, which depends on 
            how the background was removed.</div><h4>Radius of structuring element</h4><div>
            This radius should correspond to the radius of the textures of interest <i>after</i> 
            subsampling; i.e., if textures in the original image scale have a radius of 40 
            pixels, and a subsampling factor of 0.25 is used, the structuring element size should be
            10 or slightly smaller, and the range of the spectrum defined below will cover more sizes.</div><h4>Range of the granular spectrum</h4><div>
            You may need a trial run to see which granular 
            spectrum range yields informative measurements. Start by using a wide spectrum and 
            narrow it down to the informative range to save time.</div></div></body></html>
