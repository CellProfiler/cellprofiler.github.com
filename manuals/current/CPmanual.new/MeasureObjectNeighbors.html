<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>MeasureObjectNeighbors</title></head><body><h1>Module: MeasureObjectNeighbors</h1><div><b>Measure Object Neighbors</b> calculates how many neighbors each  object has and records various properties about the neighbors' relationships,  including the percentage of an object's edge pixels that touch a neighbor. <hr> Given an image with objects identified (e.g., nuclei or cells), this module determines how many neighbors each object has. You can specify  the distance within which objects should be considered neighbors, or  that objects are only considered neighbors if they are directly touching.<p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <b>Object measurements</b> <ul> <li><i>NumberOfNeighbors:</i> Number of neighbor objects.</li> <li><i>PercentTouching:</i> Percent of the object's boundary pixels that touch  neighbors, after the objects have been expanded to the specified distance. Note: This measurement is only available if you use the same set of objects for both objects and neighbors.</li> <li><i>FirstClosestObjectNumber:</i> The index of the closest object.</li> <li><i>FirstClosestDistance:</i> The distance to the closest object.</li> <li><i>SecondClosestObjectNumber:</i> The index of the second closest object.</li> <li><i>SecondClosestDistance:</i> The distance to the second closest object.</li> <li><i>AngleBetweenNeighbors:</i> The angle formed with the object center as the  vertex and the first and second closest object centers along the vectors.</li> </ul><p><b>Object relationships:</b> The identity of the neighboring objects, for  each object. Since per-object output is one-to-one and neighbors relationships  are often many-to-one, they may be saved as a separate file in  <b>ExportToSpreadsheet</b> by selecting <i>Object relationships</i> from the list of objects to export.<p><h4>Technical notes</h4>  Objects discarded via modules such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> or  <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b> will still register as a neighbors for the purposes of accurate measurement. For instance, if an object touches a single object and  that object had been discarded, <i>NumberOfNeighbors</i> will be positive, but  there will not be a corresponding <i>ClosestObjectNumber</i>.<p>See also the <b>Identify</b> modules. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select objects to measure</h4><div>
            Select the objects whose neighbors you want to measure.</div><h4>Select neighboring objects to measure</h4><div>
            This is the name of the objects that are potential
            neighbors of the above objects. You can find the neighbors
            within the same set of objects by selecting the same objects
            as above.</div><h4>Method to determine neighbors</h4><div>
            There are several methods by which to determine whether objects are neighbors:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Adjacent:</i> In this mode, two objects must have adjacent 
            boundary pixels to be neighbors. </li>
            <li><i>Expand until adjacent:</i> The objects are expanded until all
            pixels on the object boundaries are touching another. Two objects are 
            neighbors if their any of their boundary pixels are adjacent after 
            expansion.</li>
            <li><i>Within a specified distance:</i> Each object is expanded by 
            the number of pixels you specify. Two objects are  
            neighbors if they have adjacent pixels after expansion. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For <i>Adjacent</i> and <i>Expand until adjacent</i>, the
            <i>PercentTouching</i> measurement is the percentage of pixels on the boundary 
            of an object that touch adjacent objects. For <i>Within a specified distance</i>, 
            two objects are touching if their any of their boundary 
            pixels are adjacent after expansion and <i>PercentTouching</i> measures the 
            percentage of boundary pixels of an <i>expanded</i> object that 
            touch adjacent objects.</p></div><h4>Neighbor distance</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when "Within a specified distance" is selected)</i> <br>
            The Neighbor distance is the number of pixels that each object is 
            expanded for the neighbor calculation. Expanded objects that touch 
            are considered neighbors.</div><h4>Retain the image of objects colored by numbers of neighbors?</h4><div>
            An output image showing the input objects 
            colored by numbers of neighbors may be retained. A colormap of your choice shows 
            how many neighbors each object has. The background is set 
            to -1. Objects are colored with an increasing color value 
            corresponding to the number of neighbors, such that objects with no 
            neighbors are given a color corresponding to 0. Use the <b>SaveImages</b>
            module to save this image to a file.</div><h4>Name the output image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the image of objects colored by numbers of neighbors 
            is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i> <br> 
            Specify a name 
            that will allow the the image of objects colored by numbers of neighbors 
            to be selected later in the pipeline.</div><h4>Select colormap</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the image of objects colored by numbers of neighbors 
            is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i> <br>
            Select the colormap to use to color the neighbor number image. All available colormaps can be seen

            Select <i>Yes</i> to keep an image of the input objects 
            colored by the percentage of the boundary touching their neighbors.
            A colormap of your choice is used to show the touching percentage of 
            each object. Use the <b>SaveImages</b> module to save this image to a file.</div><h4>Name the output image</h4><div>

            is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i> <br> 
            Specify a name that will allow the the image of objects colored by percent of touching 
            pixels to be selected later in the pipeline.</div><h4>Select a colormap</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the image of objects colored by percent touching
