<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>MeasureObjectIntensity</title></head><body><h1>Module: MeasureObjectIntensity</h1><div><b>Measure Object Intensity</b> measures several intensity features for  identified objects. <hr> Given an image with objects identified (e.g. nuclei or cells), this module extracts intensity features for each object based on one or more corresponding grayscale images. Measurements are recorded for each object.<p><p>Intensity measurements are made for all combinations of the images and objects entered. If you want only specific image/object measurements, you can  use multiple MeasureObjectIntensity modules for each group of measurements desired.</p><p><p>Note that for publication purposes, the units of intensity from microscopy images are usually described as "Intensity units" or "Arbitrary intensity units" since microscopes are not  calibrated to an absolute scale. Also, it is important to note whether  you are reporting either the mean or the integrated intensity, so specify "Mean intensity units" or "Integrated intensity units" accordingly.</p><p><p>Keep in mind that the default behavior in CellProfiler is to rescale the  image intensity from 0 to 1 by dividing all pixels in the image by the  maximum possible intensity value. This "maxmimum possible" value is defined by the "Set intensity range from" setting in <b>NamesAndTypes</b>; see the help for that setting for more details.</p><p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <ul><li><i>IntegratedIntensity:</i> The sum of the pixel intensities within an  object.</li> <li><i>MeanIntensity:</i> The average pixel intensity within an object.</li> <li><i>StdIntensity:</i> The standard deviation of the pixel intensities within  an object.</li> <li><i>MaxIntensity:</i> The maximal pixel intensity within an object.</li> <li><i>MinIntensity:</i> The minimal pixel intensity within an object.</li> <li><i>IntegratedIntensityEdge:</i> The sum of the edge pixel intensities of an  object.</li> <li><i>MeanIntensityEdge:</i> The average edge pixel intensity of an object.</li> <li><i>StdIntensityEdge:</i> The standard deviation of the edge pixel intensities  of an object.</li> <li><i>MaxIntensityEdge:</i> The maximal edge pixel intensity of an object.</li> <li><i>MinIntensityEdge:</i> The minimal edge pixel intensity of an object.</li> <li><i>MassDisplacement:</i> The distance between the centers of gravity in the  gray-level representation of the object and the binary representation of  the object.</li> <li><i>LowerQuartileIntensity:</i> The intensity value of the pixel for which 25%  of the pixels in the object have lower values.</li> <li><i>MedianIntensity:</i> The median intensity value within the object</li> <li><i>MADIntensity:</i> The median absolute deviation (MAD) value of the intensities within the object.
