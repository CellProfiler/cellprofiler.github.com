This module identifies dead worms by fitting a straight shape to a binary image at many different angles to identify the regions where the shape could fit. Each placement point has a x and y location and an angle associated with the fitted shape's  placement. Conceptually, these can be visualized in three dimensions with the z direction being the angle (and with the angle, 0, being adjacent to the largest angle as well as the smallest angle greater than zero). The module labels the resulting 3-D volume. It records the X, Y and angle of the centers of each of the found objects and creates objects by collapsing the 3-D volume to 2-D. These objects can then be used as seeds for <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>.<p><p><b>IdentifyDeadWorms</b> fits a diamond shape to the image. The shape is defined by its width and length. The length is the distance in pixels along the long axis of the diamond and should be less than the length of the shortest dead worm to be detected. The width is the distance in pixels along the short axis of the diamond and should be less than the width of the worm.</p><p><h4>References</h4> <ul> <li>Peng H, Long F, Liu X, Kim SK, Myers EW (2008) "Straightening <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> images." <i>Bioinformatics</i>, 24(2):234-42.<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btm569">(link)</a></li> <li>W&auml;hlby C, Kamentsky L, Liu ZH, Riklin-Raviv T, Conery AL, O'Rourke EJ,  Sokolnicki KL, Visvikis O, Ljosa V, Irazoqui JE, Golland P, Ruvkun G, Ausubel FM, Carpenter AE (2012).

            The name of a binary image from a previous module.
            <b>IdentifyDeadWorms</b> will use this image to establish the
            foreground and background for the fitting operation. You can use
            <b>ApplyThreshold</b> to threshold a grayscale image and
            create the binary mask. You can also use a module such as
            <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> to label each worm and then use
            <b>ConvertObjectsToImage</b> to make the result a mask.</div><h4>Name the dead worm objects to be identified</h4><div>
            This is the name for the dead worm objects. You can refer
            to this name in subsequent modules such as
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b></div><h4>Worm width</h4><div>
            This is the width (the short axis), measured in pixels,
            of the diamond used as a template when
            matching against the worm. It should be less than the width
            of a worm.</div><h4>Worm length</h4><div>
            This is the length (the long axis), measured in pixels, 
            of the diamond used as a template when matching against the
            worm. It should be less than the length of a worm</div><h4>Number of angles</h4><div>
            This is the number of different angles at which the
            template will be tried. For instance, if there are 12 angles,
            the template will be rotated by 0&deg;, 15&deg;, 30&deg;, 45&deg; ... 165&deg;.
            The shape is bilaterally symmetric; that is, you will get the same shape
            after rotating it by 180&deg;.</div><h4>Automatically calculate distance parameters?</h4><div>
            This setting determines whether or not
            <b>IdentifyDeadWorms</b> automatically calculates the parameters
            used to determine whether two found-worm centers belong to the
            same worm. 
            <p>Select <i>Yes</i> to have <b>IdentifyDeadWorms</b>
            automatically calculate the distance from the worm length
            and width. Select <i>No</i> to set the distances manually.</p></div><h4>Spatial distance</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if not automatically calculating distance parameters)</i><br>
            Enter the distance for calculating the worm centers, in units of pixels. 
            The worm centers must be at least many pixels apart for the centers to
            be considered two separate worms.</div><h4>Angular distance</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if automatically calculating distance parameters)</i><br>
            <b>IdentifyDeadWorms</b> calculates the worm centers at different
            angles. Two worm centers are considered to represent different
            worms if their angular distance is larger than this number. The
            number is measured in degrees.</div></div></body></html>
