<body><h1>Using the Data Tools Menu</h1>
<div>

The <i>Data Tools</i> menu provides tools to allow you
to plot, view, export or perform specialized analyses on your measurements.

<p>Each data tool has a corresponding module with the same name and 
functionality. The difference between the data tool and the module is that the
data tool takes a CellProfiler output file (i.e., a <i>.mat or .h5</i> file) 
as input, which contains measurements from a previously completed analysis run. 
In contrast, a module uses measurements
received from the upstream modules during an in-progress analysis run.</p>

<p>Opening a data tool will present a prompt in which the user is asked to provide
the location of the output file. Once specified, the user is then prompted to
enter the desired settings. The settings behave identically as those from the 
corresponding module.</p>

<p>Help for each <i>Data Tool</i> is available under <i>Help > Data Tool Help</i> or the corresponding
module help.</p></div></body>
