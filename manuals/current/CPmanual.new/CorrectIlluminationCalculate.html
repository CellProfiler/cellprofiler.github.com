This function will correct for the uneven illumination in images.   If saving, select <i>.mat</i> format in <b>SaveImages</b>.   Use the <b>CorrectIlluminationApply</b> module to apply the function to the image to be corrected.<p>Illumination correction is a challenge to do properly; please see the  <a href="http://www.cellprofiler.org/examples.html">examples</a> and  <a href="http://www.cellprofiler.org/tutorials.html">tutorials</a> pages  on the CellProfiler website for further advice.<p>See also <b>CorrectIlluminationApply</b>, <b>EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the input image</h4><div>
            Choose the image to be used to calculate the illumination function.</div><h4>Name the output image</h4><div>
            Enter a name for the resultant illumination function.</div><h4>Select how the illumination function is calculated</h4><div>
            Choose which method you want to use to calculate the illumination function. You may chose
            from the following options:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Regular:</i> If you have objects that are evenly dispersed across your image(s) and
             cover most of the image, the <i>Regular</i> method might be appropriate. Regular
             intensities makes the illumination function based on the intensity at
             each pixel of the image (or group of images if you are in <i>All</i> mode) and
             is most often rescaled (see below) and applied by division using
             <b>CorrectIlluminationApply.</b> Note that if you are in <i>Each</i> mode or using a
             small set of images with few objects, there will be regions in the
             average image that contain no objects and smoothing by median filtering
             is unlikely to work well.
             <i>Note:</i> it does not make sense to choose (<i>Regular + No smoothing + Each</i>)
             because the illumination function would be identical to the original
             image and applying it will yield a blank image. You either need to smooth
             each image, or you need to use <i>All</i> images.</li>
             <li><i>Background:</i>
             If you think that the background (dim points) between objects show the
             same pattern of illumination as your objects of interest, you can choose the
             <i>Background</i> method. Background intensities finds the minimum pixel
             intensities in blocks across the image (or group of images if you are in
             <i>All</i> mode) and is most often applied by subtraction using the
             <b>CorrectIlluminationApply</b> module.
             <i>Note:</i> if you will be using the <i>Subtract</i> option in the
             <b>CorrectIlluminationApply</b> module, you almost certainly do not want to
             rescale the illumination function. </li>
             </ul> 
             <p>Please note that if a mask was applied to the input image, the pixels outside of the
             mask will be excluded from consideration. This is useful, for instance, in cases where
             you have masked out the well edge in an image from a multi-well plate; the dark well 
             edge would distort the illumination correction function along the interior well edge.
             Masking the image beforehand solves this problem.</p></div><h4>Dilate objects in the final averaged image?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the Regular method is selected)</i><br>
            For some applications, the incoming images are binary and each object
            should be dilated with a Gaussian filter in the final averaged
            (projection) image. This is for a sophisticated method of illumination
            correction where model objects are produced.
            Select <i>Yes</i> to dilate objects for this approach.
            </div><h4>Dilation radius</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the "Regular" method and dilation is selected)</i><br>
            This value should be roughly equal to the original radius of the objects</div><h4>Block size</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if "Background" is selected)</i><br>
            The block size should be large enough that every square block of pixels is likely 
            to contain some background pixels, where no objects are located.</div><h4>Rescale the illumination function?</h4><div>
            The illumination function can be rescaled so that the pixel intensities
            are all equal to or greater than 1. You have the following options:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Yes:</i> Rescaling is recommended if you plan to
            use the <i>Regular</i> method (and hence, the <i>Divide</i> option in 
            <b>CorrectIlluminationApply</b>) so that the corrected images are in the 
            range 0 to 1.</li>
            <li><i>No:</i> Rescaling is not recommended if you plan to use the <i>Background</i> 
            method, which is paired with the <i>Subtract</i> option in <b>CorrectIlluminationApply</b>. 
            Note that as a result of the illumination function being rescaled from 1 to
            infinity, the rescaling of each image might be dramatic if there is substantial 
            variation across the field of view, causing the corrected images
            to be very dark. </li>
            <li>Median<i>:</i> This option chooses the median value in the 
            image to rescale so that division increases some values and decreases others.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Calculate function for each image individually, or based on all images?</h4><div>
            Calculate a separate function for each image, or one for all the images?
            You can calculate the illumination function using just the current
            image or you can calculate the illumination function using all of
            the images in each group.
            The illumination function can be calculated in one of the three ways:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Each:</i> Calculate an illumination function for each image 
            individually. </li>
            <li><i>All: First cycle:</i> Calculate an illumination 
            function based on all of the images in a group, performing the
            calculation before proceeding to the next module. This means that the
            illumination function will be created in the first cycle (making the first 
            cycle longer than subsequent cycles), and lets you use the function in a subsequent
            <b>CorrectIllumination_Apply</b> module in the same pipeline, but also
            means that you will not have the ability to filter out images (e.g., by using
            <b>FlagImage</b>). The input images need to be produced by a <b>LoadImage</b> 
            or <b>LoadData</b> module; using images produced by other modules will yield an error.</li>
            <li><i>All: Across cycles:</i> Calculate an illumination function 
            across all cycles in each group. This option takes any image
            as input; however, the illumination function 
            will not be completed until the end of the last cycle in the group.
            You can use <b>SaveImages</b> to save the illumination function
            after the last cycle in the group and then use the resulting
            image in another pipeline. The option is useful if you want to exclude
            images that are filtered by a prior <b>FlagImage</b> module.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Smoothing method</h4><div>
             If requested, the resulting image is smoothed. See the
             <b>EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures</b> module help for more details. If you are using <i>Each</i> mode,
             this is almost certainly necessary. If you have few objects in each image or a
             small image set, you may want to smooth. 
             <p>You should smooth to the point where the illumination function resembles a believable pattern.
             For example, if you are trying to correct a lamp illumination problem, 
             apply smoothing until you obtain a fairly smooth pattern
             without sharp bright or dim regions.  Note that smoothing is a
             time-consuming process, but some methods are faster than others.
             <ul>
             <li><i>Fit Polynomial:</i> This methdod is fastest but does not
             allow a very tight fit compared to the slower median and Gaussian 
             filtering methods. </li>
             <li>Median Filter, <i>Gaussian Filter:</i> Use a 
             median or Gaussian filter, respectively. We typically recommend <i>Median Filter</i> 
             vs. <i>Gaussian Filter</i> because the median 
             is less sensitive to outliers, although the results are also slightly 
             less smooth and the fact that images are in the range of 0 to 1 means that
             outliers typically will not dominate too strongly anyway.</li>
             <li><i>Smooth to Average:</i> A less commonly
             used option is to completely smooth the entire image, which will create a flat, 
             smooth image where every pixel of the image is the average of what the illumination 
             function would otherwise have been.</li>
             <li><i>Splines:</i> This method (<i>Lindblad and Bengtsson, 2001</i>) 
             fits a grid of cubic splines to the background while
             excluding foreground pixels from the calculation. It operates
             iteratively, classifying pixels as background, computing a best
             fit spline to this background and then reclassifying pixels
             as background until the spline converges on its final value.</li>
             <li><i>Convex Hull:</i> This method algorithm proceeds as follows:
             <ul><li>Choose 256 evenly-spaced intensity levels between the
             minimum and maximum intensity for the image</li>
             <li>Set the intensity of the output image to the minimum intensity
             of the input image</li>
             <li>Iterate over the intensity levels, from lowest to highest
             <ul>
             <li>For a given intensity, find all pixels with 
             equal or higher intensities</li>
             <li>Find the convex hull that encloses those pixels</li>
             <li>Set the intensity of the output image within the convex hull
             to the current intensity</li>
             </ul></li>
             </ul>
             The Convex Hull method can be used on an image whose objects
             are darker than their background and whose illumination
             intensity decreases monotonically from the brightest point.</li>
             </ul>

            <i>(Used only if a smoothing method other than Fit Polynomial is selected)</i><br>
            Calculate the smoothing filter size. There are three options:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Automatic:</i> The size is computed as 1/40 the size of the image or 
            30 pixels, whichever is smaller.</li>
            <li><i>Object size:</i> The size is obtained relative to the width 
            of artifacts to be smoothed.</li>
            <li><i>Manually:</i> Use a manually entered value.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Approximate object size</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Automatic is selected for smoothing filter size calculation)</i><br>
            Enter the approximate width of the artifacts to be smoothed, in pixels.</div><h4>Smoothing filter size</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Manually is selected for smoothing filter size calculation)</i><br>
            Enter the size of the desired smoothing filter, in pixels.</div><h4>Automatically calculate spline parameters?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Splines are selected for the smoothing method)</i><br>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to automatically calculate
            the parameters for spline fitting. 
            <p>Select <i>No</i> to specify the background mode, background threshold, scale,
            maximum number of iterations and convergence.</p></div><h4>Background mode</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Splines are selected for the smoothing method and 
            spline parameters are not calculated automatically)</i><br>
            This setting determines which pixels are background
            and which are foreground.<br>
            <ul><li><i>auto</i>: Determine the mode from the image.
            This will set the mode to dark if most of the pixels are
            dark, bright if most of the pixels are bright and
            gray if there are relatively few dark and light pixels
            relative to the number of mid-level pixels</li>
            <li><i>dark</i>: Fit the spline to the darkest pixels
            in the image, excluding brighter pixels from consideration.
            This may be appropriate for a fluorescent image.
            </li>
            <li><i>bright</i>: Fit the spline to the lightest pixels
            in the image, excluding the darker pixels. This may be appropriate
            for a histologically stained image.</li>
            <li><i>gray</i>: Fit the spline to mid-range pixels,
            excluding both dark and light pixels. This may be appropriate
            for a brightfield image where the objects of interest have
            light and dark features.</li></ul></div><h4>Number of spline points</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Splines are selected for the smoothing method and 
            spline parameters are not calculated automatically)</i><br>
            This is the number of control points for the spline.
            A value of 5 results in a 5x5 grid of splines across the image and
            is the value suggested by the method's authors. A lower value
            will give you a more stable background while a higher one will
            fit variations in the background more closely and take more time
            to compute.</div><h4>Background threshold</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Splines are selected for the smoothing method and 
            spline parameters are not calculated automatically)</i><br>
            This setting determines the cutoff used when excluding
            foreground pixels from consideration. On each iteration,
            the method computes the standard deviation of background
            pixels from the computed background. The number entered in this
            setting is the number of standard deviations a pixel can be
            from the computed background on the last pass if it is to
            be considered as background during the next pass.
            <p>
            You should enter a higher number to converge stabily and slowly
            on a final background and a lower number to converge more
            rapidly, but with lower stability. The default for this
            parameter is two standard deviations; this will provide a fairly
            stable background estimate.</div><h4>Image resampling factor</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Splines are selected for the smoothing method and 
            spline parameters are not calculated automatically)</i><br>
            This setting controls how the image is resampled to
            make a smaller image. Resampling will speed up processing,
            but may degrade performance if the resampling factor is larger
            than the diameter of foreground objects. The image will
            be downsampled by the factor you enter. For instance, a 500x600
            image will be downsampled into a 250x300 image if a factor of 2
            is entered.</div><h4>Maximum number of iterations</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Splines are selected for the smoothing method and 
            spline parameters are not calculated automatically)</i><br>
            This setting determines the maximum number of iterations
            of the algorithm to be performed. The algorithm will perform
            fewer iterations if it converges.</div><h4>Residual value for convergence</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Splines are selected for the smoothing method and 
            spline parameters are not calculated automatically)</i><br>
            This setting determines the convergence criterion.
            The software sets the convergence criterion to the number entered
            here times the signal intensity; the convergence you enter is the
            fraction of the signal intensity that indicates convergence.
            The algorithm derives a standard deviation of the background
            pixels from the calculated background on each iteration. The
            algorithm terminates when the difference between the standard
            deviation for the current iteration and the previous iteration
            is less than the convergence criterion.
            <p>Enter a smaller number for the convergence to calculate a
            more accurate background. Enter a larger number to calculate
            the background using fewer iterations, but less accuracy.</div><h4>Retain the averaged image?</h4><div>
            The averaged image is the illumination function
            prior to dilation or smoothing. It is an image produced during the calculations, not typically
            needed for downstream modules. It can be helpful to retain it in case you wish to try several 
            different smoothing methods without taking the time to recalculate the averaged image each time.
            <p>Select <i>Yes</i> to retain this averaged image. Use the <b>SaveImages</b> module to save 
            it to your hard drive.</p></div><h4>Name the averaged image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the averaged image is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i><br>
            Enter a name that will allow the averaged image to be selected later in the pipeline.</div><h4>Retain the dilated image?</h4><div>                                            
            The dilated image is the illumination function after dilation but prior to smoothing. 
            It is an image produced during the calculations, and is not typically needed for downstream modules.
            <p>Select <i>Yes</i> to retain this dilated image. Use the <b>SaveImages</b> module to save it 
            to your hard drive.</p></div><h4>Name the dilated image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the dilated image is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i><br>
            Enter a name that will allow the dilated image to be selected later in the pipeline.</div></div>
