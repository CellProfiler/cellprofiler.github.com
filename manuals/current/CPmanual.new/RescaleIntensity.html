<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>RescaleIntensity</title></head><body><h1>Module: RescaleIntensity</h1><div><b>RescaleIntensity</b> changes the intensity range of an image to your  desired specifications. <hr> This module lets you rescale the intensity of the input images by any of several methods. You should use caution when interpreting intensity and texture measurements derived from images that have been rescaled because certain options for this module do not preserve the relative intensities from image to image. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the input image</h4><div>Select the image to be rescaled.</div><h4>Name the output image</h4><div>Enter the name of output rescaled image.</div><h4>Rescaling method</h4><div>
            There are a number of options for rescaling the input image: 
            <ul>
            <li><i>Stretch each image to use the full intensity range:</i> Find the minimum and maximum values within the unmasked part of the image 
            (or the whole image if there is no mask) and rescale every pixel so that 
            the minimum has an intensity of zero and the maximum has an intensity of one.</li>
            <li><i>Choose specific values to be reset to the full intensity range:</i> Pixels are
            scaled from their user-specified original range to the range 0 to 1.
            Options are available to handle values outside of the original range.<br>
            To convert 12-bit images saved in 16-bit format to the correct range,
            use the range 0 to 0.0625. The value 0.0625 is equivalent 
            to 2<sup>12</sup> divided by 2<sup>16</sup>, so it will convert a 16 bit image containing 
            only 12 bits of data to the proper range.</li>
            <li><i>Choose specific values to be reset to a custom range:</i> Pixels are scaled from their original range to
            the new target range. Options are available to handle values outside
            of the original range.</li>
            <li><i>Divide by the image's minimum:</i> Divide the intensity value of each pixel 
            by the image's minimum intensity value so that all pixel intensities are equal to or 
            greater than 1. The rescaled image can serve as an illumination correction function in 
            <b>CorrectIlluminationApply</b>.</li>
            <li><i>Divide by the image's maximum:</i> Divide the intensity value of each pixel by the 
            image's maximum intensity value so that all pixel intensities are less than or equal to 1.</li>
            <li><i>Divide each image by the same value:</i> Divide the intensity value of each pixel by the value entered.</li>
            <li><i>Divide each image by a previously calculated value:</i> The intensity value of each pixel is divided by some 
            previously calculated measurement. This measurement can be the output of some other module
            or can be a value loaded by the <b>Metadata</b> module.</li>
            <li><i>Match the image's maximum to another image's maximum:</i> Scale an image so that its maximum value is the 
            same as the maximum value within the reference image.</li>
            <li><i>Convert to 8 bit:</i> Images in CellProfiler are normally stored as a floating 
            point number in the range of 0 to 1. This option converts these images to class uint8, 
            meaning an 8 bit integer in the range of 0 to 255, 
            reducing the amount of memory required to store the image. <i>Warning:</i> Most
            CellProfiler modules require the incoming image to be in the standard 0
            to 1 range, so this conversion may cause downstream modules to behave 
            in unexpected ways.</li>

            <i>(Used only if "Choose specific values to be reset to a custom range" is selected)</i><br>
            This setting controls how the minimum intensity is determined.
            <ul>
            <li><i>Custom:</i> Enter the minimum intensity manually below.</li>
            <li><i>Minimum for each image</i>: use the lowest intensity in this image
            as the minimum intensity for rescaling</li>
            <li><i>Minimum of all images</i>: use the lowest intensity from all images
            in the image group or the experiment if grouping is not being used.
            <b>Note:</b> Choosing this option may have undesirable results for
            a large ungrouped experiment split into a number of batches. Each batch
            will open all images from the chosen channel at the start of the run.
            This sort of synchronized action may have a severe impact on your
            network file system.</li>

            <i>(Used only if "Choose specific values to be reset to a custom range" is selected)</i><br>
            There are several ways to handle values less than the lower limit of the intensity range:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Mask pixels:</i> Creates a mask for the output image. All pixels below
            the lower limit will be masked out.</li>
            <li><i>Set to zero:</i> Sets all pixels below the lower limit to zero.</li>
            <li><i>Set to custom value:</i> Sets all pixels below the lower limit to a custom
            value.</li>
            <li><i>Scale similarly to others:</i> Scales pixels with values below the lower limit
            using the same offset and divisor as other pixels. The results
            will be less than zero.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Custom value for pixels below lower limit</h4><div>
