<body><h1>Setting the Output Filename</h1>
<div>

<p>Please note that the output file will be deprecated in the future. This setting
is temporarily present for those needing HDF5 or MATLAB formats, and will be moved to 
Export modules in future versions of CellProfiler.</p>

<p>The <i>output file</i> is a file where all information about the analysis as well 
as any measurements will be stored to the hard drive. <b>Important note:</b> This file 
does <i>not</i> provide the same functionality as the Export modules. If you want to 
produce a spreadsheet of measurements easily readable by Excel or a database viewer 
(or similar programs), please refer to the <b>ExportToSpreadsheet</b> or 
<b>ExportToDatabase</b> modules and the associated help.</p>

<p>The options associated with the output file are accessible by pressing the 
"View output settings" button at the bottom of the pipeline panel. In the 
settings panel to the left, in the <i>Output Filename</i> box, you can specify the 
name of the output file.</p>

<p>The output file can be written in one of two formats:
<ul>
<li>A <i>.mat file</i> which is readable by CellProfiler and by 
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">MATLAB</a> (Mathworks). </li>
<li>An <i>.h5 file</i> which is readable by CellProfiler, MATLAB and any other program
capable of reading the HDF5 data format. Documentation on
how measurements are stored and handled in CellProfiler using this format can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler/wiki/Module-Structure-and-Data-Storage-Retrieval#hdf5-measurement-and-workspace-format">here</a>.</li>
</li>
</ul>
Results in the output file can also be accessed or exported
using <b>Data Tools</b> from the main menu of CellProfiler.
The pipeline with its settings can be be loaded from an output file using 
<i>File > Load Pipeline...</i></p>

<p>The output file will be saved in the Default Output Folder unless you type a 
full path and file name into the file name box. The path must not have 
spaces or characters disallowed by your computer's platform.</p>
                                                                           
<p>If the output filename ends in <i>OUT.mat</i> (the typical text appended to 
an output filename), CellProfiler will prevent you from overwriting this file 
on a subsequent run by generating a new file name and asking if you want to 
use it instead. You can override this behavior by checking the <i>Allow 
overwrite?</i> box to the right.</p>

<p>For analysis runs that generate a large number of measurements, you may notice
that even though the analysis completes, CellProfiler continues to use 
an inordinate amount of your CPU and RAM. This is because the output file is written
after the analysis is completed and can take a very long time for a lot of measurements.
If you do not need this file and/or notice this behavior, select "<i>Do not write measurements</i>" 
from the "Measurements file format" drop-down box.</p></div></body>
