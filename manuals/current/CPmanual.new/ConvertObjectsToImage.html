<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>ConvertObjectsToImage</title></head><body><h1>Module: ConvertObjectsToImage</h1><div><b>Convert Objects To Image </b> converts objects you have identified into an image. <hr><p>This module allows you to take previously identified objects and convert them into an image according to a colormap you select, which can then be saved  with the <b>SaveImages</b> modules.<p><p>If you would like to save your objects but do not need a colormap, you can by bypass this module and use the <b>SaveImages</b> module directly  by specifying "Objects" as the type of image to save. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the input objects</h4><div>
            Choose the name of the objects you want to convert to an image.</div><h4>Name the output image</h4><div>
            Enter the name of the resulting image.</div><h4>Select the color format</h4><div>
            Select which colors the resulting image should use. You have the following
            options:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Color:</i> Allows you to choose a colormap that will
            produce jumbled colors for your objects. </li>
            <li><i>Binary (black & white):</i> All object pixels will be assigned 1 and all
            background pixels will be assigned 0, creating a binary image.</li>
            <li><i>Grayscale:</i> Gives each object
            a graylevel pixel intensity value corresponding to its number (also
            called label), so it usually results in objects on the left side of the
            image being very dark, progressing toward white on the right side of
            the image. </li>
            <li><i>uint16:</i> Assigns each object a different number,
            from 1 to 65535 (the numbers that you can put in
            a 16-bit integer) and numbers all pixels in each
            object with the object's number. This format can
            be written out as a .mat or .tiff file if you
            want to process the label matrix image using
            another program.</li>
            </ul>
            You can choose <i>Color</i> with a <i>Gray</i> colormap to produce
            jumbled gray objects.</div><h4>Select the colormap</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Color output image selected)</i><br>
            Choose the colormap to be used, which affects how the objects are colored. 
            You can look up your default colormap under <i>File > Preferences</i>.</div></div></body></html>
