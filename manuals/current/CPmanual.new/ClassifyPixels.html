<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>ClassifyPixels</title></head><body><h1>Module: ClassifyPixels</h1><div><b>ClassifyPixels</b> classify image pixels as belonging to different  classes using the machine-learning tool, ilastik. <hr><p>ClassifyPixels performs per-pixel classification using the  <a href="http://www.ilastik.org/">ilastik</a> application. Ilastik is now bundled with the CellProfiler distribution; it applies supervised machine learning techniques to images to learn their features. A user trains a classifier with Ilastik and then saves the classifier. The user then uses the ClassifyPixels module to classify the pixels in an image. <p>ClassifyPixels produces an "image" consisting of probabilities that the pixel belongs to the chosen class; this image is similar to an intensity image that would be produced by fluorescence imaging. Provided that the classifier is sufficiently accurate, the image is well-suited for input into one of the <b>Identify</b> modules for object detection. More instructions on using the interface may be found  <a href="http://ilastik.org/index.php?cat=20_Documentation&page=03_Cellprofiler">here</a>. Please note that you must use the same image format for classification as for the initial learning phase.<p>Currently, ilastik is only available for Windows, and is accessible from in the CellProfiler folder under the Start Menu. A 64-bit system is  recommended for running ilastik. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Classifier file location</h4><div>
                Select the folder containing the classifier file to be loaded. 
            
You can choose among the following options which are common to all file input/output 
modules:
<ul>
<li><i>Default Input Folder</i>: Use the default input folder.</li>
<li><i>Default Output Folder:</i> Use from the default output folder.</li>
<li><i>Elsewhere...</i>: Use a particular folder you specify.</li>
<li><i>Default input directory sub-folder</i>: Enter the name of a subfolder of 
the default input folder or a path that starts from the default input folder.</li>
<li><i>Default output directory sub-folder</i>: Enter the name of a subfolder of 
the default output folder or a path that starts from the default output folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Elsewhere</i> and the two sub-folder options all require you to enter an additional 
path name. You can use an <i>absolute path</i> (such as "C:\imagedir\image.tif" on a PC) or a 
<i>relative path</i> to specify the file location relative to a directory):
<ul>
<li>Use one period to represent the current directory. For example, if you choose 
<i>Default Input Folder sub-folder</i>, you can enter "./MyFiles" to look in a 
folder called "MyFiles" that is contained within the Default Input Folder.</li>
<li>Use two periods ".." to move up one folder level. For example, if you choose 
<i>Default Input Folder sub-folder</i>, you can enter "../MyFolder" to look in a 
folder called "MyFolder" at the same level as the Default Input Folder.</li>
</ul></p>
</div><h4>Classfier file name</h4><div>This is the name of the Classfier file.</div><h4>Select the class</h4><div>Select the class you want to use. The class number 
            corresponds to the label-class in ilastik</div></div></body></html>
