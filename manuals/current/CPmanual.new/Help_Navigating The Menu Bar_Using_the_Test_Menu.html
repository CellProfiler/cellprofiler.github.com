<body><h1>Using the Test Menu</h1>
<div>
 
<p>Before starting an analysis run, you can test the pipeline settings on a selected image 
cycle using the <i>Test</i> mode option on 
the main menu. Test mode allows you to run the pipeline on a selected
image, preview the results and adjust the module settings on the fly.</p>

<p>To enter Test mode once you have built a pipeline, choose <i>Test > Start Test Mode</i> from the
menu bar in the main window. At this point, you will see the following features appear:
<ul>
<li>The module view will have a slider bar appearing on the far left.</li>
<li>A Pause icon <img src="images\IMG_GO.png">&nbsp;
will appear to the left of each module.</li>
<li>A series of buttons will appear at the bottom of the pipeline panel above the 
module adjustment buttons.</li>
<li>The grayed-out items in the <i>Test</i> menu will become active, and the 
<i>Analyze Images</i> button will become inactive.
</ul>
</p>

<p>You can run your pipeline in Test mode by selecting <i>Test > Step to Next Module</i>
or clicking the <i>Run</i> or <i>Step</i> buttons at the bottom of the pipeline panel. 
The pipeline will execute normally, but you will
be able to back up to a previous module or jump to a downstream module, change
module settings to see the results, or execute the pipeline on the image of your choice.
The additional controls allow you to do the following:
<ul>
<li><i>Slider:</i> Start/resume execution of the pipeline at any time by moving the slider. However, 
if the selected module depends on objects and/or images
generated by prior modules, you will see an error message indicating that the data has not 
been produced yet. To avoid this, it is best to actually run the pipeline up to the module
of interest, and move the slider to modules already executed.
<li><i>Pause:</i> Clicking the pause icon will cause the pipeline test run to halt
execution when that module is reached (the paused module itself is not executed). The icon 
changes from <img src="images\IMG_GO.png">&nbsp;to 
<img src="images\IMG_PAUSE.png">&nbsp;to indicate that a pause has 
been inserted at that point.</li>
<li><i>Run:</i> Execution of the pipeline will be started/resumed until
the next module pause is reached. When all modules have been executed for a given image cycle,
execution will stop.</li>
<li><i>Step:</i> Execute the next module (as indicated by the slider location)</li>
<li><i>Next Image:</i> Skip ahead to the next image cycle as determined by the image 
order in the Input modules. The slider will automatically return to the 
first module in the pipeline.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>From the <i>Test</i> menu, you can choose additional options:
<ul>
<li><i>Exit Test Mode:</i> Exit <i>Test</i> mode. Loading a new pipeline or adding/subtracting
modules will also automatically exit test mode.</li>
<li><i>Step to Next Module:</i> Execute the next module (as indicated by the slider location)</li>
<li><i>Next Image Set:</i> Step to the next image set in the current image group.</li>
<li><i>Next Image Group:</i> Step to the next group in the image set. 
The slider will then automatically return to the first module in the pipeline.</li>
<li><i>Random Image Set:</i> Randomly select and jump to an image set in the current image group.</li>
<li><i>Choose Image Set:</i> Choose the image set to jump to.
The slider will then automatically return to the first module in the pipeline.</li>
<li><i>Choose Image Group:</i> Choose an image group to jump to.
The slider will then automatically return to the first module in the pipeline.</li>
<li><i>Reload Modules Source (enabled only if running from source code):</i> This option will reload 
the module source code, so any changes to the code will be reflected immediately.</li>
</ul>
Note that if movies are being loaded, the individual movie is defined as a group automatically.
Selecting <i>Choose Image Group</i> will allow you to choose the movie file, and <i>Choose Image Set</i> 
will let you choose the individual movie frame from that file.
<p>Please see the <b>Groups</b> module for more details on the 
proper use of metadata for grouping</p>
