<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>DisplayPlatemap</title></head><body><h1>Module: DisplayPlatemap</h1><div><b>Display Platemap </b> displays a desired measurement in a plate map view. <hr> <b>Display Platemap</b> is a tool for browsing image-based data laid out on  multi-well plates common to high-throughput biological screens. The display window for this module shows a plate map with each well color-coded according to the measurement chosen. <p><p>As the pipeline runs, the measurement information displayed is updated, so  the value shown for each well is current up to the image cycle currently being  processed; wells which have no corresponding measurements as yet as shown as  blank.<p>See also <b>DisplayDensityPlot</b>, <b>DisplayHistogram</b>,  <b>DisplayScatterPlot</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Display object or image measurements?</h4><div>
            <ul>
            <li><i>Image</i> allows you to select an image 
            measurement to display for each well.</li> 
            <li><i>Object</i> allows you to select an object measurement to display 
            for each well.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Select the object whose measurements will be displayed</h4><div>
            Choose the name of objects identified by some previous 
            module (such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> or 
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>) whose measurements are to be displayed.</div><h4>Select the measurement to plot</h4><div>
            Choose the image or object measurement made by a previous module to plot.</div><h4>Select your plate metadata</h4><div>
            Choose the metadata tag that corresponds to the plate identifier. That is,
            each plate should have a metadata tag containing a specifier corresponding
            uniquely to that plate. 
            <p>Please see the <b>Metadata</b> module for more details on metadata collection and usage.</p></div><h4>Multiwell plate format</h4><div>The module assumes that your data is laid out in a multi-well plate format
            common to high-throughput biological screens. Supported formats are:
            <ul>
            <li><i>96:</i> A 96-well plate with 8 rows &times; 12 columns</li>
            <li><i>384:</i> A 384-well plate with 16 rows &times; 24 columns</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Select your well metadata</h4><div>
            Choose the metadata tag that corresponds to the well identifier. 
            The row-column format of these entries should be an 
            alphabetical character (specifying the plate row), followed by two integer 
            characters (specifying the plate column). For example, a standard format 
            96-well plate would span from "A1" to "H12", whereas a 384-well plate (16 
            rows and 24 columns) would span from well "A01" to well "P24"." 
            <p>Please see the <b>Metadata</b> module for more details on metadata collection and usage.</p></div><h4>Select your well row metadata</h4><div>
            Choose the metadata tag that corresponds to the well row identifier, typically
            specified as an alphabetical character. For example, a standard format 
            96-well plate would span from  row "A" to "H", whereas a 384-well plate (16 
            rows and 24 columns) would span from row "A" to "P".
            <p>Please see the <b>Metadata</b> module for more details on metadata collection and usage.</p></div><h4>Select your well column metadata</h4><div>
            Choose the metadata tag that corresponds to the well column identifier, typically
            specified with two integer characters. For example, a standard format 
            96-well plate would span from column "01" to "12", whereas a 384-well plate (16 
            rows and 24 columns) would span from column "01" to "24".
            <p>Please see the <b>Metadata</b> module for more details on metadata collection and usage.</p></div><h4>How should the values be aggregated?</h4><div>
            Measurements must be aggregated to a 
            single number for each well so that they can be represented by a color. 
            Options are:
            <ul>
            <li><i>avg:</i> Average</li>
            <li><i>stdev:</i> Standard deviation</li>
            <li><i>median</i></li>
            <li><i>cv%:</i> Coefficient of variation, defined as the ratio of the standard 
            deviation to the mean. This is useful for comparing between data sets with 
            different units or widely different means.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Enter a title for the plot, if desired</h4><div>
            Enter a title for the plot. If you leave this blank,
            the title will default 
            to <i>(cycle N)</i> where <i>N</i> is the current image 
            cycle being executed.</div><h4>Well metadata format</h4><div>
            <ul>
            <li> <i>Well name</i> allows you to select an image 
            measurement to display for each well.</li> 
            <li><i>Row & Column</i> allows you to select an object measurement to display 
            for each well.</li>
            </ul></div></div></body></html>
