<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>LoadImages</title></head><body><h1>Module: LoadImages</h1><div><b>Load Images</b> allows you to specify which images or movies are to be loaded and in which order. <hr> This module tells CellProfiler where to retrieve images and gives each image a meaningful name by which other modules can access it. You can also use <b>LoadImages</b> to extract or define the relationships between images and their associated  metadata. For example, you could load a group of images (such as three channels that represent the same field  of view) together for processing in a single CellProfiler cycle. Finally, you can use this module to retrieve a label matrix and give the collection of objects a meaningful name.<p><p><i>Disclaimer:</i> Please note that the Input modues (i.e., <b>Images</b>, <b>Metadata</b>, <b>NamesAndTypes</b> and <b>Groups</b>) largely supercedes this module. However, old pipelines loaded into  CellProfiler that contain this module will provide the option of preserving them;  these pipelines will operate exactly as before.</p><p><p>When used in combination with a <b>SaveImages</b> module, you can load images in one file format and save them in another, using CellProfiler as a file format converter.</p><p><h5>Using metadata in LoadImages</h5><p><p>If you would like to use the metadata-specific settings, please see <i>Help > General help > Using metadata in CellProfiler</i> for more details on metadata usage and syntax. Briefly, <b>LoadImages</b> can extract metadata from the image filename using pattern-matching strings, for grouping similar images  together for the analysis run and for metadata-specfic options in other modules; see the settings help for <a href='#where_to_extract'><i>Where to extract metadata</i></a>, and if an option for that setting is  selected, <a href='#regular_expression'><i>Regular expression  that finds metadata in the file name</i></a> for the necessary syntax.</p><p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <ul> <li><i>Pathname, Filename:</i> The full path and the filename of each image.</li> <li><i>Metadata:</i> The metadata information extracted from the path and/or  filename, if requested.</li> <li><i>Scaling:</i> The maximum possible intensity value for the image format.</li>  <li><i>Height, Width:</i> The height and width of the current image.</li>  </ul><p>See also the <b>Input</b> modules, <b>LoadData</b>, <b>LoadSingleImage</b>, <b>SaveImages</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>File type to be loaded</h4><div>
            CellProfiler accepts the following image file types. For movie file formats, 
            the files are opened as a stack of images and each image is processed individually, although <b> TrackObjects</b> 
            can be used to relate objects across timepoints.
            <ul>
            <li><i>individual images:</i> Each file represents a single image. 
            Some methods of file compression sacrifice image quality ("lossy") and should be avoided for automated image analysis 
            if at all possible (e.g., .jpg). Other file compression formats retain exactly the original image information but in 
            a smaller file ("lossless") so they are perfectly acceptable for image analysis (e.g., .png, .tif, .gif). 
            Uncompressed file formats are also fine for image analysis (e.g., .bmp).</li>
            <li><i>avi,mov movies:</i> AVIs (Audio Video Interleave) and MOVs (QuicktTime) files are types of movie files. Only 
            uncompressed AVIs are supported; supported MOVs are listed <a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats-format/quicktime-movie">here</a>.
            Note that .mov files are not supported on 64-bit systems.</li>
            <li><i>stk movies:</i> STKs are a proprietary image format used by MetaMorph (Molecular Devices). It is typically
            used to encode 3D image data, e.g. from confocal microscopy, and is a special version of the TIF format. </li>
            <li><i>tif,tiff,flex,zvi movies:</i> A TIF/TIFF movie is a file that contains a series of images as individual frames. 
            The same is true for the FLEX file format (used by Evotec Opera automated microscopes). ZVIs are a proprietary image 
            format used by Zeiss. It is typically
            used to encode 3D image data, e.g. from fluorescence microscopy. </li>
            </ul></div><h4>File selection method</h4><div>
            Three options are available:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Text-Exact match:</i> Used to load image (or movie) files that have a particular piece of
            text in the name. The specific text that is entered will be searched for in the filenames and
            the files that contain that text exactly will be loaded and given the name you specify. 
            The search for the text is case-sensitive.</li>
            <li><i>Text-Regular expressions:</i> Used to load image (or movie) files that match
            a pattern of regular expressions. 
Patterns are specified using
combinations of metacharacters and literal characters. There are a few
classes of metacharacters, partially listed below. Some helpful links follow:
<ul>

<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.3/lib/re-syntax.html">here</a></li>
<li>A helpful quick reference can be found <a href="http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet/">here</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pythex.org/">Pythex</a> provides quick way to test your regular expressions. Here is an 
<a href="http://pythex.org/?regex=Channel%5B1-2%5D-%5B0-9%5D%7B2%7D-(%3FP%3CWellRow%3E%5BA-H%5D)-(%3FP%3CWellColumn%3E%5B0-9%5D%7B2%7D)%5C.tif&test_string=Channel1-01-A-01.tif&ignorecase=0&multiline=0&dotall=0&verbose=0">example</a>
to capture information from a common microscope nomenclature.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following metacharacters match exactly one character from its respective set of characters:<br><br>
<table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#555555"><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Metacharacter</b></font></th><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Meaning</b></font></th></tr>
<tr><td>.</td><td>Any character</td></tr>
<tr><td>[]</td><td>Any character contained within the brackets</td></tr>
<tr><td>[^]</td><td>Any character not contained within the brackets</td></tr>
<tr><td>\w</td><td>A word character [a-z_A-Z0-9]</td></tr>
<tr><td>\W</td><td>Not a word character [^a-z_A-Z0-9]</td></tr>
<tr><td>\d</td><td>A digit [0-9]</td></tr>
<tr><td>\D</td><td>Not a digit [^0-9]</td></tr>
<tr><td>\s</td><td>Whitespace [ \t\r\n\f\v]</td></tr>
<tr><td>\S</td><td>Not whitespace [^ \t\r\n\f\v]</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The following metacharacters are used to logically group subexpressions
or to specify context for a position in the match. These metacharacters
do not match any characters in the string:<br><br>
<table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#555555"><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Metacharacter</b></font></th><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Meaning</b></font></th></tr>
<tr><td>( )</td><td>Group subexpression</td></tr>
<tr><td>|</td><td>Match subexpression before or after the |</td></tr>
<tr><td>^</td><td>Match expression at the start of string</td></tr>
<tr><td>$</td><td>Match expression at the end of string</td></tr>
<tr><td>\&lt;</td><td>Match expression at the start of a word</td></tr>
<tr><td>\&gt;</td><td>Match expression at the end of a word</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The following metacharacters specify the number of times the previous
metacharacter or grouped subexpression may be matched:<br><br>
<table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#555555"><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Metacharacter</b></font></th><th><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Meaning</b></font></th></tr>
<tr><td>*</td><td>Match zero or more occurrences</td></tr>
<tr><td>+</td><td>Match one or more occurrences</td></tr>
<tr><td>?</td><td>Match zero or one occurrence</td></tr>
<tr><td>{n,m}</td><td>Match between n and m occurrences</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Characters that are not special metacharacters are all treated literally
in a match. To match a character that is a special metacharacter, escape
that character with a '\'. For example '.' matches any character, so to
match a '.' specifically, use '\.' in your pattern.

Examples:
<ul>
<li><code>[trm]ail</code> matches 'tail' or 'rail' or 'mail'.</li>
<li><code>[0-9]</code> matches any digit between 0 to 9.</li>
<li><code>[^Q-S]</code> matches any character other than 'Q' or 'R' or 'S'.</li>
<li><code>[[]A-Z]</code> matches any upper case alphabet along with square brackets.</li>
<li><code>[ag-i-9]</code> matches characters 'a' or 'g' or 'h' or 'i' or '-' or '9'.</li>
<li><code>[a-p]*</code> matches '' or 'a' or 'aab' or 'p' etc.</li>
<li><code>[a-p]+</code> matches  'a' or 'abc' or 'p' etc.</li>
<li><code>[^0-9]</code> matches any string that is not a number.</li>
<li><code>^[0-9]*$</code> matches either a blank string or a natural number.</li>
<li><code>^-[0-9]+$|^\+?[0-9]+$</code> matches any integer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
            <li><i>Order:</i> Used when image (or movie) files are present in a repeating order,
            like "DAPI, FITC, Red; DAPI, FITC, Red;" and so on. Images are
            loaded based on the order of their location on the hard disk, and they are
            assigned an identity based on how many images are in each group and what position
            within each group the file is located (e.g., three images per
            group; DAPI is always first).</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Number of images in each group?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when Order is selected for file loading)</i><br>
            Enter the number of images that comprise a group. For example, for images given in the order:
            <i>DAPI, FITC, Red; DAPI, FITC, Red</i> and so on, the number of images that in each group would be 3.</div><h4>Exclude certain files?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if "Text-Exact match" for loading files is selected)</i> <br>
            The image/movie files specified with the <i>Text</i> options may also include
            files that you want to exclude from analysis (such as thumbnails created 
            by an imaging system). Select <i>Yes</i> to enter text to match against
            such files for exclusion.</div><h4>Type the text that the excluded images have in common</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if file exclusion is selected)</i> <br>
            Specify text that marks files for exclusion. <b>LoadImages</b> looks for this text as an 
            exact match within the filename and not as a regular expression. </div><h4>Analyze all subfolders within the selected folder?</h4><div>
            This setting determines whether <b>LoadImages</b> analyzes
            just the images in the specified folder or whether it analyzes
            images in subfolders as well:
            <ul>
            <li><i>All:</i> Analyze all matching image files in subfolders under your 
            specified image folder location. </li>
            <li><i>None:</i> Only analyze files in the specified location.</li>
            <li><i>Some:</i> Select which subfolders to analyze.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Select subfolders to analyze</h4><div>
            Use this control to select some subfolders and exclude
            others from analysis. Press the button to see the folder tree
            and check or uncheck the checkboxes to enable or disable analysis
            of the associated folders.</div><h4>Check image sets for unmatched or duplicate files?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if metadata is extracted from the image file and not loading by order)</i><br>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to examine the filenames for 
            unmatched or duplicate files based on extracted metadata. This is useful for images
            generated by HCS systems where acquisition may produce a corrupted image and create
            a duplicate as a correction or may miss an image entirely. See 
            the <i>Extract metadata from where?</i> setting for more details on obtaining, extracting, 
            and using metadata tags.</div><h4>Group images by metadata?</h4><div>
            <a name='group_by_metadata'></a>
            <i>(Used only if metadata is extracted from the image file or if movies are used)</i><br>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to process those images that share a particular
            metadata tag as a group. For example, if you are performing per-plate illumination correction and the
            plate metadata is part of the image file name, image grouping will enable you to
            process those images that have the same plate field together (the alternative would be
            to place the images from each plate in a separate folder). The next setting allows you
            to select the metadata tags by which to group.Please see the <b>Groups</b> module for more details on the 
proper use of metadata for grouping
            
            <p>Please note that if you are loading a movie file(e.g., TIFs, FLEX, STKs, AVIs, ZVIs), each movie
            is already treated as a group of images, so there is no need to enable here.</div><h4>Specify metadata fields to group by</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if grouping images by metadata)</i> <br>
            Select the fields by which you want group the image files. You can select multiple tags. For
            example, if a set of images had metadata for "Run", "Plate", "Well", and
            "Site", selecting <i>Run</i> and <i>Plate</i> will create groups containing 
            images that share the same [<i>Run</i>,<i>Plate</i>] pair of fields.</div><h4>Text that these images have in common (case-sensitive)</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only for the image-loading Text options)</i><br>
            For <i>Text-Exact match</i>, type the text string that all the 
            images have in common. For example, if all the images for the given 
            channel end with the text "D.TIF", type <tt>D.TIF</tt> here.
            <p>For <i>Text-Regular expression</i>, type the regular expression 
            that would capture all the images for this channel. See the module 
            help for more information on regular expressions.</div><h4>Position of this image in each group</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only for the image-loading Order option)</i><br>
            Enter the number in the image order that this image channel 
            occupies. For example, if the order is "DAPI, FITC, Red; 
            DAPI, FITC, Red" and so on, the DAPI channel would occupy 
            position 1.</div><h4>Load the input as images or objects?</h4><div>
            This setting determines whether you load an image as image data
            or as segmentation results (i.e., objects):
            <ul>
            <li><i>Images:</i> The input image will be given a user-specified name by
            which it will be refered downstream. This is the most common usage for this
            module.</li>
            <li><i>Objects:</i> Use this option if the input image is a label matrix 
            and you want to obtain the objects that it defines. A <i>label matrix</i>
            is a grayscale or color image in which the connected regions share the
            same label, and defines how objects are represented in CellProfiler.
            The labels are integer values greater than or equal to 0. 
            The elements equal to 0 are the background, whereas the elements equal to 1 
            make up one object, the elements equal to 2 make up a second object, and so on.
            This option allows you to use the objects without needing to insert an 
            <b>Identify</b> module to extract them first. See <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> 
            for more details.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Name this loaded image</h4><div>
            What do you want to call the images you are loading for use 
            downstream in the pipeline? Give your images a meaningful name 
            that you can use to refer to these images in later modules.  Keep 
            the following points in mind:
            <ul>
            <li>Image names can consist of any combination of characters 
            (e.g., letters, digits, and other non-alphanumeric characters). 
            However, if you are using <b>ExportToDatabase</b>, these names will 
            become part of the measurement column name, and some characters
            are not permitted in MySQL (e.g., slashes).</li>
            <li>Names are not case sensitive. Therefore, <i>OrigBlue</i>, 
            <i>origblue</i>, and <i>ORIGBLUE</i> will all correspond to the 
            same name, and unexpected results may ensue.</li>
            <li>Although CellProfiler can accept names of any length, you may 
            want to avoid making the name too long, especially if you are 
            uploading to a database. The name is used to generate the column 
            header for a given measurement, and in MySQL the total bytes used
            for all column headers cannot exceed 64K. A warning will be 
            generated later if this limit has been exceeded.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Name this loaded object</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if objects are output)</i><br>
            This is the name for the objects loaded from your image</div><h4>Retain outlines of loaded objects?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if objects are output)</i><br>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if you want to create an image of the outlines
            of the loaded objects.</div><h4>Name the outline image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if objects are output and outlines are saved)</i> <br> 
            Enter a name that will allow the outlines to be selected later in the pipeline.
            <p><i>Special note on saving images:</i> You can use the settings in this module
            to pass object outlines along to the module <b>OverlayOutlines</b>, and then save
            them with the <b>SaveImages</b> module.</div><h4>Channel number</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if a movie image format is selected as file type and movie frame grouping is selected)</i><br>
            The channels of a multichannel image are numbered starting from 1.
            Each channel is a greyscale image, acquired using different
            illumination sources and/or optics. Use this setting to pick
            the channel to associate with the above image name.</div><h4>Rescale intensities?</h4><div>
            This option determines whether image metadata should be
            used to rescale the image's intensities. Some image formats
            save the maximum possible intensity value along with the pixel data.
            For instance, a microscope might acquire images using a 12-bit
            A/D converter which outputs intensity values between zero and 4095,
            but stores the values in a field that can take values up to 65535.
            <p>Select <i>Yes</i> to rescale the image intensity so that
            saturated values are rescaled to 1.0 by dividing all pixels
            in the image by the maximum possible intensity value. </p>
            <p>Select <i>No</i> to ignore the image metadata and rescale the image
            to 0 &ndash; 1.0 by dividing by 255 or 65535, depending on the number
            of bits used to store the image.</p></div><h4>Extract metadata from where?</h4><div>
            <a name='where_to_extract'>Metadata fields can be specified from 
            the image filename, the image path (including subfolders), or both. 
            The metadata entered here can be used for image grouping (see the  
            <i>Group images by metadata?</i> setting) or simply used as 
            additional columns in the exported 
            measurements (see the <b>ExportToSpreadsheet</b> module).</a></div><h4>Regular expression that finds metadata in the file name</h4><div>
            <a name='regular_expression'><i>(Used only if you want to extract 
            metadata from the file name)</i><br>
            The regular expression to extract the metadata from the file name 
            is entered here. Note that this field is available whether you have 
            selected <i>Text-Regular expressions</i> to load the files or not.
            Please see the general module help for more information on 
            construction of a regular expression.</a>
            <p>Clicking the magnifying glass icon to the right will bring up a
            tool for checking the accuracy of your regular expression. The 
            regular expression syntax can be used to name different parts of 
            your expression. The syntax <i>(?P&lt;fieldname&gt;expr)</i> will 
            extract whatever matches <i>expr</i> and assign it to the 
            measurement,<i>fieldname</i> for the image.
            <p>For instance, a researcher uses plate names composed of a string 
            of letters and numbers, followed by an underscore, then the well, 
            followed by another underscore, followed by an "s" and a digit
            representing the site taken within the well (e.g., <i>TE12345_A05_s1.tif</i>).
            The following regular expression will capture the plate, well, and 
            site in the fields "Plate", "Well", and "Site":<br><br>
            <table border = "1">
            <tr><td colspan = "2">^(?P&lt;Plate&gt;.*)_(?P&lt;Well&gt;[A-P][0-9]{1,2})_s(?P&lt;Site&gt;[0-9])</td></tr>
            <tr><td>^</td><td>Start only at beginning of the file name</td></tr>
            <tr><td>(?P&lt;Plate&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Plate</i></td></tr>
            <tr><td>.*</td><td>Capture as many characters as follow</td></tr>
            <tr><td>_</td><td>Discard the underbar separating plate from well</td></tr>
            <tr><td>(?P&lt;Well&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Well</i></td></tr>
            <tr><td>[A-P]</td><td>Capture exactly one letter between A and P</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[0-9]{1,2}</td><td>Capture one or two digits that follow</td></tr>
            <tr><td>_s</td><td>Discard the underbar followed by <i>s</i> separating well from site</td></tr>
            <tr><td>(?P&lt;Site&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Site</i></td></tr>
            <tr><td>[0-9]</td><td>Capture one digit following</td></tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>The regular expression can be typed in the upper text box, with 
            a sample file name given in the lower text box. Provided the syntax 
            is correct, the corresponding fields will be highlighted in the same
            color in the two boxes. Press <i>Submit</i> to enter the typed 
            regular expression.</p>
            
            <p>You can create metadata tags for any portion of the filename or path, but if you are
            specifying metadata for multiple images in a single <b>LoadImages</b> module, an image cycle can 
            only have one set of values for each metadata tag. This means that you can only 
            specify the metadata tags which have the same value across all images listed in the module. For example,
            in the example above, you might load two wavelengths of data, one named <i>TE12345_A05_s1_w1.tif</i>
            and the other <i>TE12345_A05_s1_w2.tif</i>, where the number following the <i>w</i> is the wavelength. 
            In this case, a "Wavelength" tag <i>should not</i> be included in the regular expression
            because while the "Plate", "Well" and "Site" metadata is identical for both images, the wavelength metadata is not.</p>
            
            <p>Note that if you use the special fieldnames <i>&lt;WellColumn&gt;</i> and 
            <i>&lt;WellRow&gt;</i> together, LoadImages will automatically create a <i>&lt;Well&gt;</i>
            metadata field by joining the two fieldname values together. For example, 
            if <i>&lt;WellRow&gt;</i> is "A" and <i>&lt;WellColumn&gt;</i> is "01", a field 
            <i>&lt;Well&gt;</i> will be "A01". This is useful if your well row and column names are
            separated from each other in the filename, but you want to retain the standard 
            well nomenclature.</p></div><h4>Type the regular expression that finds metadata in the subfolder path</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if you want to extract metadata from the path)</i><br>
            Enter the regular expression for extracting the metadata from the 
            path. Note that this field is available whether you have selected 
            <i>Text-Regular expressions</i> to load the files or not.
            
            <p>Clicking the magnifying glass icon to the right will bring up a
            tool that will allow you to check the accuracy of your regular 
            expression. The regular expression syntax can be used to 
            name different parts of your expression. The syntax 
            <i>(?&lt;fieldname&gt;expr)</i> will extract whatever matches 
            <i>expr</i> and assign it to the image's <i>fieldname</i> measurement.
                        
            <p>For instance, a researcher uses folder names with the date and 
            subfolders containing the images with the run ID 
            (e.g., <i>./2009_10_02/1234/</i>) The following regular expression 
            will capture the plate, well, and site in the fields 
            <i>Date</i> and <i>Run</i>:<br>
            <table border = "1">
            <tr><td colspan = "2">.*[\\/](?P&lt;Date&gt;.*)[\\/](?P&lt;Run&gt;.*)$</td></tr>
            <tr><td>.*[\\/]</td><td>Skip characters at the beginning of the pathname until either a slash (/) or
            backslash (\) is encountered (depending on the operating system)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>(?P&lt;Date&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Date</i></td></tr>
            <tr><td>.*</td><td>Capture as many characters that follow</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[\\/]</td><td>Discard the slash/backslash character</td></tr>
            <tr><td>(?P&lt;Run&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Run</i></td></tr>
            <tr><td>.*</td><td>Capture as many characters as follow</td></tr>
            <tr><td>$</td><td>The <i>Run</i> field must be at the end of the path string, i.e., the
            last folder on the path. This also means that the Date field contains the parent
            folder of the Date folder.</td></tr>
            </table></p></div><h4>Group the movie frames?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if a movie image format is selected as file type)</i><br>
            <b>LoadImages</b> can load several frames from a movie
            into different images within the same cycle. For example, a movie's
            first frame might be an image of the red fluorescence channel at
            time zero, the second might be the green channel at time zero,
            the third might be the red channel at time one, etc. 
            Select <i>Yes</i> to extract both channels for this movie
            as separate images within the same cycle.
            <p>
            <b>LoadImages</b> refers to the individual images in a group
            as <i>channels</i>. Channels are numbered consecutively, starting
            at channel 1. To set up grouping, first specify how the channels
            are grouped (interleaving and number of channels per group), then
            assign image names to each of the channels individually.
            </div><h4>Grouping method</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if a movie image format is selected as file type and movie frame grouping are selected)</i><br>
            Channels in a movie can be interleaved or separated.
            <p>In an interleaved movie, the first frame is channel 1, the second
            is channel 2 and so on up to the number of channels per group for a given
            image cycle.
            In a separated movie, all of the frames for channel 1 are processed as the first
            image cycle, then the frames for channel 2 for the second image cycle, and so on. 
            
            <p>For example, a movie may consist of 6 frames and we would like to
            process the movie as two channels per group. An interleaved movie would be processed like this:
            <p><table border="1">
            <tr><th>Frame #</th><th>Channel #</th><th>Image cycle #</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr></table><br>
            
            <p>For a separated movie, the channels would be processed like this:<br>
            <p><table border="1">
            <tr><th>Frame #</th><th>Channel #</th><th>Image cycle #</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr></table>
            
            <p>Note the difference in which frames are processed in which image cycle
            between the two methods.</div><h4>Number of channels per group</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if a movie image format is selected as file type and movie frame grouping is selected)</i><br>
            This setting controls the number of frames to be
            grouped together. As an example, for an interleaved movie with
            12 frames and three channels per group, the first, fourth,
            seventh and tenth frame will be assigned to channel 1, the
            2<sup>nd</sup>, 5,<sup>th</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> frame will be assigned to
            channel 2 and the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> will be
            assigned to channel 3. For a separated movie, frames 1 through 4
            will be assigned to channel 1, 5 through 8 to channel 2 and
            9 through 12 to channel 3.</div><h4>Input image file location</h4><div>Select the folder containing the images to be loaded. 
            
You can choose among the following options which are common to all file input/output 
modules:
<ul>
<li><i>Default Input Folder</i>: Use the default input folder.</li>
<li><i>Default Output Folder:</i> Use from the default output folder.</li>
<li><i>Elsewhere...</i>: Use a particular folder you specify.</li>
<li><i>Default input directory sub-folder</i>: Enter the name of a subfolder of 
the default input folder or a path that starts from the default input folder.</li>
<li><i>Default output directory sub-folder</i>: Enter the name of a subfolder of 
the default output folder or a path that starts from the default output folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Elsewhere</i> and the two sub-folder options all require you to enter an additional 
path name. You can use an <i>absolute path</i> (such as "C:\imagedir\image.tif" on a PC) or a 
<i>relative path</i> to specify the file location relative to a directory):
<ul>
<li>Use one period to represent the current directory. For example, if you choose 
<i>Default Input Folder sub-folder</i>, you can enter "./MyFiles" to look in a 
folder called "MyFiles" that is contained within the Default Input Folder.</li>
<li>Use two periods ".." to move up one folder level. For example, if you choose 
<i>Default Input Folder sub-folder</i>, you can enter "../MyFolder" to look in a 
folder called "MyFolder" at the same level as the Default Input Folder.</li>
</ul></p>
