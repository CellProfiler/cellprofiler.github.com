<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>ClassifyObjects</title></head><body><h1>Module: ClassifyObjects</h1><div><b>Classify Objects</b> classifies objects into different classes according  to the value of measurements you choose. <hr> This module classifies objects into a number of different bins according to the value of a measurement (e.g., by size, intensity, shape). It reports how many objects fall into each class as well as the percentage of objects that fall into each class. The module asks you to  select the measurement feature to be used to classify your objects and specify the bins to use. It also requires you to have run a measurement or  <b>CalculateMath</b> previous to this module in the pipeline so that the measurement values can be used to classify the objects. <p><p>There are two flavors of classification: <ul> <li>The first classifies each object according to the measurements you choose and assigns each object to one class per measurement. You may specify more than two classification bins per measurement. </li> <li>The second classifies each object according to two measurements and two threshold values. The module classifies each object once per measurement resulting in four possible object classes. The module then stores one measurement per object, based on the object's class.</li> </ul> </p> <p>Note that objects without a measurement are not counted as belonging in a  classification bin and will not show up in the output image (shown in the  module display window); in the object classification they will have a value of False for all bins. However, they are still counted in the total number of objects  and hence are reflected in the classification percentages.</p><p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <ul> <li><b>Image measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>NumObjectsPerBin:</i> The number of objects that are classified  into each bin.</li> <li><i>PctObjectsPerBin:</i> The percentage of total objects that are  classified into each bin.</li> </ul> </li> <li><b>Object measurements:</b> <ul> <li>Single measurement: Classification (true/false) of the N<sup>th</sup>  bin for the M<sup>th</sup> measurement.</li> <li>Two measurement: Classification (true/false) of the 1<sup>st</sup>  measurement versus the 2<sup>nd</sup> measurement  binned into bins above ("high") and below ("low") the cutoff.</li> </ul> </li> </ul><p>See also <b>CalculateMath</b> and any of the modules in the <b>Measure</b> category. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Make each classification decision on how many measurements?</h4><div>
            This setting controls how many measurements are used to make a classifications decision
            for each object:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Single measurement:</i> Classifies each object based on a single measurement.</li>
            <li><i>Pair of measurements:</i> Classifies each object based on a pair of measurements taken 
            together (that is, an object must meet two criteria to belong to a class).</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Select the object to be classified</h4><div>The name of the objects to be classified. You can
            choose from objects created by any previous module. See
            <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>, <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>, or
            <b>IdentifyTertiaryObjects</b>.</div><h4>Select the measurement to classify by</h4><div>
            Select a measurement made by a previous module. The objects
            will be classified according to their values for this 
            measurement.</div><h4>Select bin spacing</h4><div>
            You can either specify bins of equal size, bounded by
            upper and lower limits, or you can specify custom values that
            define the edges of each bin with a threshold. 
            
            <i>Note:</i> If you would like two bins, choose <i>Custom-defined bins</i> and then provide a single threshold when asked. 
            <i>Evenly spaced bins</i> creates the indicated number of bins
            at evenly spaced intervals between the low and high threshold.
            You also have the option to create bins for objects that fall below
            or above the low and high threhsold</div><h4>Number of bins</h4><div>
            This is the number of bins that will be created between
            the low and high threshold</div><h4>Lower threshold</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Evenly spaced bins selected)</i><br>
            This is the threshold that separates the lowest bin from the
            others. The lower threshold, upper threshold, and number of bins
            define the thresholds of bins between the lowest and highest.</div><h4>Use a bin for objects below the threshold?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if you want to create a bin for objects
            whose values fall below the low threshold. Select <i>No</i>
            if you do not want a bin for these objects.</div><h4>Upper threshold</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Evenly spaced bins selected)</i><br>
            This is the threshold that separates the last bin from
            the others.
            <i>Note:</i> If you would like two bins, choose <i>Custom-defined bins</i>.</div><h4>Use a bin for objects above the threshold?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if you want to create a bin for objects
            whose values are above the high threshold. <br>
            Select <i>No</i> if you do not want a bin for these objects.</div><h4>Enter the custom thresholds separating the values between bins</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Custom thresholds selected)</i><br>
            This setting establishes the threshold values for the
            bins. You should enter one threshold between each bin, separating
            thresholds with commas (for example, <i>0.3, 1.5, 2.1</i> for four bins).
            The module will create one more bin than there are thresholds.</div><h4>Give each bin a name?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to assign custom names to bins you have 
            specified. 
            <p>Select <i>No</i> for the module to automatically
            assign names based on the measurements and the bin number.</div><h4>Enter the bin names separated by commas</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if Give each bin a name? is checked)</i><br>
            Enter names for each of the bins, separated by commas.
            An example including three bins might be <i>First,Second,Third</i>.</div><h4>Retain an image of the classified objects?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to keep an image of the objects which is color-coded according
            to their classification, for use later in the pipeline (for example,
            to be saved by a <b>SaveImages</b> module).</div><h4>Name the output image</h4><div>
            Enter the name to be given to the classified object
            image.</div><h4>Select the object name</h4><div>
            Choose the object that you want to measure from the list.
            This should be an object created by a previous module such as
            <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>, <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>, or
            <b>IdentifyTertiaryObjects</b>.</div><h4>Select the first measurement</h4><div>
            Choose a measurement made on the above object. This is
            the first of two measurements that will be contrasted together.
            The measurement should be one made on the object in a prior
            module.</div><h4>Method to select the cutoff</h4><div>
            Objects are classified as being above or below a cutoff
            value for a measurement. You can set this cutoff threshold in one
            of three ways:<br>
            <ul>
            <li><i>Mean</i>: At the mean
            of the measurement's value for all objects in the image cycle.</li>
            <li><i>Median</i>: At the median of the
            measurement's value for all objects in the image set.</li>
            <li><i>Custom</i>: You specify a custom threshold value.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Enter the cutoff value</h4><div>
            This is the cutoff value separating objects in the two 
            classes.</div><h4>Select the second measurement</h4><div>
            Select a measurement made on the above object. This is
            the second of two measurements that will be contrasted together.
            The measurement should be one made on the object in a prior
            module.</div><h4>Method to select the cutoff</h4><div>
            Objects are classified as being above or below a cutoff
            value for a measurement. You can set this cutoff threshold in one
            of three ways:<br>
            <ul>
            <li><i>Mean:</i> At the mean
            of the measurement's value for all objects in the image cycle.</li>
            <li><i>Median:</i> At the median of the
            measurement's value for all objects in the image set.</li>
            <li><i>Custom:</i> You specify a custom threshold value.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Use custom names for the bins?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if you want to specify the names of each bin 
            measurement. <br>
            Select <i>No</i> to create names based on the 
            measurements. For instance, for
            "Intensity_MeanIntensity_Green" and "Intensity_TotalIntensity_Blue",
            the module generates measurements such as
            "Classify_Intensity_MeanIntensity_Green_High_Intensity_TotalIntensity_Low".</div><h4>Enter the low-low bin name</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if using a pair of measurements)</i><br>
            Name of the measurement for objects that
            fall below the threshold for both measurements.</div><h4>Enter the low-high bin name</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if using a pair of measurements)</i><br>
            Name of the measurement for objects whose
            first measurement is below threshold and whose second measurement
            is above threshold.</div><h4>Enter the high-low bin name</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if using a pair of measurements)</i><br>
            Name of the measurement for objects whose
            first measurement is above threshold and whose second measurement
            is below threshold.</div><h4>Enter the high-high bin name</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if using a pair of measurements)</i><br>
            Name of the measurement for objects that
            are above the threshold for both measurements.</div><h4>Retain an image of the classified objects?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to retain the image of the objects color-coded according
            to their classification, for use later in the pipeline (for example,
            to be saved by a <b>SaveImages</b> module).</div><h4>Enter the image name</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if the classified object image is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i> <br>
            Enter the name to be given to the classified object image.</div></div></body></html>
