<body><h1>How Measurements are Named</h1>
<div>

In CellProfiler, measurements are exported as well as stored internally using the 
following general nomenclature:
<code><i>MeasurementType_Category_SpecificFeatureName_Parameters</i></code>

<p>Below is the description for each of the terms:
<ul>
<li><code>MeasurementType</code>: The type of data contained in the measurement, which can be
one of three forms:
<ul>
<li><i>Per-image:</i> These measurements are image-based (e.g., thresholds, counts) and 
are specified with the name "Image" or with the measurement (e.g.,
"Mean") for per-object measurements aggregated over an image.</li>
<li><i>Per-object:</i> These measurements are per-object and are specified as the name given 
by the user to the identified objects (e.g., "Nuclei" or "Cells")</li>
<li><i>Experiment:</i> These measurements are produced for a particular measurement 
across the entire analysis run (e.g., Z'-factors), and are specified with the 
name "Experiment". See <b>CalculateStatistics</b> for an example.
</ul></li>

<li><code>Category:</code> Typically, this information is specified in one of two ways
<ul>
<li>A descriptive name indicative of the type of measurement taken (e.g., "Intensity")</li>
<li>No name if there is no appropriate <code>Category</code> (e.g., if the <i>SpecificFeatureName</i> is
"Count", no <code>Category</code> is specfied).</li>
</ul></li>

<li><code>SpecificFeatureName:</code> The specific feature recorded by a module (e.g., 
"Perimeter"). Usually the module recording the measurement assigns this name, but 
a few modules allow the user to type in the name of the feature (e.g., the 
<b>CalculateMath</b> module allows the user to name the arithmetic measurement).</li>

<li><code>Parameters:</code> This specifier is to distinguish measurements 
obtained from the same objects but in different ways. For example, 
<b>MeasureObjectIntensity</b> can measure intensities for "Nuclei" in two different 
images. This specifier is used primarily for data obtained from an individual image 
channel specified by the <b>Images</b> module or a legacy <b>Load</b> module 
(e.g.,  "OrigBlue" and "OrigGreen") or a
particular spatial scale (e.g., under the category "Texture" or "Neighbors"). Multiple 
parameters are separated by underscores.

<p>Below are additional details specific to various modules:
<ul>
<li>Measurements from the <i>AreaShape</i> and <i>Math</i> categories do not have a 
<code>Parameter</code> specifier.</li>
<li>Measurements from <i>Intensity</i>, <i>Granularity</i>, <i>Children</i>, 
<i>RadialDistribution</i>, <i>Parent</i> and
<i>AreaOccupied</i> categories will have an associated image as the Parameter.</li>
<li><i>Measurements from the <i>Neighbors</i> and <i>Texture</i> category will have a
spatial scale <code>Parameter</code>.</li>
<li>Measurements from the <i>Texture</i> and <i>RadialDistribution</i> categories will
have both a spatial scale and an image <code>Parameter</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, consider a measurement specified as <code>Nuclei_Texture_DifferenceVariance_ER_3</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>MeasurementType</code> is "Nuclei," the name given to the detected objects by the user.</li>
<li><code>Category</code> is "Texture," indicating that the module <b>MeasureTexture</b> 
produced the measurements.</li>
<li><code>SpecificFeatureName</code> is "DifferenceVariance," which is one of the many 
texture measurements made by the <b>MeasureTexture</b> module.
<li>There are two <code>Parameters</code>, the first of which is "ER". "ER" is the user-provided 
name of the image in which this texture measurement was made.</li>
<li>The second <code>Parameter</code> is "3", which is the spatial scale at which this texture 
measurement was made.</li>
</ul>

of the modules, as well as <b>ExportToSpreadsheet</b> and <b>ExportToDatabase</b> modules.
