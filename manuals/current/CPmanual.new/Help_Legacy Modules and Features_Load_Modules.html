<body><h1>Load Modules</h1>
<div>

<p>Historically, two modules served the same functionality as the current project structure: 
<b>LoadImages</b> and <b>LoadData</b>.
While the approach described above supercedes these modules in part, old pipelines
loaded into CellProfiler that contain these modules will provide the option of preserving them;
these pipelines will operate exactly as before.</p>
<p>Alternately, the user can choose to convert these 
modules into the project equivalent as closely as possible. Both modules remain accesible
via the "Add module" and <img src="images\module_add.png">&nbsp;
button at the bottom of the pipeline panel. The section details
information relevant for users who would like to continue using these modules. Please note,
however, that these modules are deprcated and may be removed in the future.</p>

<h3>Associating metadata with images</h3>
<p>Metadata (i.e., additional data about image data) is sometimes available for input images.
This information can be:
<ol>
<li>Used by CellProfiler to group images with common metadata identifiers (or "tags") 
together for particular steps in a pipeline;</li>
<li>Stored in the output file along with CellProfiler-measured features for
annotation or sample-tracking purposes;
<li>Used to name additional input/output files.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Two sources of metadata are:
<ul>
<li><i>Metadata provided in the image filename or location (pathname).</i> For example, images produced by an automated
microscope can be given names similar to "Experiment1_A01_w1_s1.tif" in which the metadata about the
plate ("Experiment1"), the well ("A01"), the wavelength number ("w1") and the imaging site ("s1") are encapsulated. The
name of the folder in which the images are saved may be meaningful and may also be considered metadata as well.
If this is the case for your data, use <b>LoadImages</b> to extract this information for
use in the pipeline and storage in the output file.</li>
<li><i>Metadata provided as a table of information</i>. Often, information associated with each image (such as
treatment, plate, well, etc) is available as a separate spreadsheet. If this is the case for your data, use 
<b>LoadData</b> to load this information.</li>
</ul>
Details for the metadata-specific help is given next to the appropriate settings in 
<b>LoadImages</b> and <b>LoadData</b>, as well the specific settings in other modules which
can make use of metadata. However, here is an overview of how metadata is obtained and used.</p>

<p>In <b>LoadImages</b>, metadata can be extracted from the filename and/or folder 
location using regular expression, a specialized syntax used for text pattern-matching.
These regular expressions can be used to identify different parts of the filename / folder. 
The syntax <i>(?P&lt;fieldname&gt;expr)</i> will extract whatever matches <i>expr</i> and 
assign it to the image's <i>fieldname</i> measurement. A regular expression tool is available 
which will allow you to check the accuracy of your regular expression.</p>

<p>For instance, say a researcher has folder names with the date and subfolders containing the
images with the run ID (e.g., <i>./2009_10_02/1234/</i>). 
The following regular expression will capture the plate, well and site in the fields 
<i>Date</i> and <i>Run</i>:<br>
<table border = "1">
<tr><td colspan = "2">.*[\\/](?P&lt;Date&gt;.*)[\\/](?P&lt;Run&gt;.*)$ </td></tr>
<tr><td>.*[\\/]</td><td>Skip characters at the beginning of the pathname until either a slash (/) or
backslash (\) is encountered (depending on the OS). The extra slash for the backslash is used as
an escape sequence.</td></tr>
<tr><td>(?P&lt;Date&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Date</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>.*</td><td>Capture as many characters that follow</td></tr>
<tr><td>[\\/]</td><td>Discard the slash/backslash character</td></tr>
<tr><td>(?P&lt;Run&gt;</td><td>Name the captured field <i>Run</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>.*</td><td>Capture as many characters as follow</td></tr>
<tr><td>$</td><td>The <i>Run</i> field must be at the end of the path string, i.e. the
last folder on the path. This also means that the <i>Date</i> field contains the parent
folder of the <i>Date</i> folder.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In <b>LoadData</b>, metadata is extracted from a CSV (comma-separated) file 
(a spreadsheet). Columns whose name begins with "Metadata" can be used to group 
files loaded by <b>LoadData</b> that are associated with a common metadata value.
The files thus grouped together are then processed as a distinct image set.</p>

<p>For instance, an experiment might require that images created on the same day 
use an illumination correction function calculated from all images from that day, 
and furthermore, that the date be captured in the file names for the individual image 
sets and in a CSV file specifying the illumination correction functions. </p>

<p>In this case, if the illumination correction images are loaded with the 
<b>LoadData</b> module, the file should have a "Metadata_Date" 
column which contains the date metadata tags. Similarly, if the individual images 
are loaded using the <b>LoadImages</b> module, <b>LoadImages</b> should be set to extract the 
<Date> metadata tag from the file names. The pipeline will then match the individual 
images with their corresponding illumination correction functions based on matching 
"Metadata_Date" fields.</p>

<h3>Using image grouping</h3>
<p>To use grouping, you must define the relevant metadata for each image. This can be done using regular
expressions in <b>LoadImages</b> or having them pre-defined in a CSV file for use in <b>LoadData</b>.</p>

<p>To use image grouping in <b>LoadImages</b>, please note the following:
<ul>
<li><i>Metadata tags must be specified for all images listed.</i> You cannot use
grouping unless an appropriate regular expression is defined for all the images listed
in the module.</li>
<li><i>Shared metadata tags must be specified with the same name for each image listed.</i> For example, if you 
are grouping on the basis of a metadata tag "Plate" in one image channel, you
must also specify the "Plate" metadata tag in the regular expression for the other channels that you 
want grouped together.</li>
</ul>
</p>
