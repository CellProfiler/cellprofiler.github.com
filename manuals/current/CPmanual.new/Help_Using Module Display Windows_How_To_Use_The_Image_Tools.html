<div>

Right-clicking in an image displayed in a window will bring up a pop-up menu with
the following options:
<ul>
<li><i>Open image in new window:</i> Displays the image in a new display window. This is useful 
for getting a closer look at a window subplot that has a small image.</li>
<li><i>Show image histogram:</i> Produces a new window containing a histogram 
of the pixel intensities in the image. This is useful for qualitatively examining
whether a threshold value determined by <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> seems 
reasonable, for example. Image intensities in CellProfiler typically range from
zero (dark) to one (bright). If you have an RGB image, the histogram shows the intensity values 
for all three channels combined, even if one or more channels is turned off for viewing.</li>
<li><i>Image contrast:</i> Presents three options for displaying the color/intensity values in 
the images:
<ul>
<li><i>Raw:</i> Shows the image using the full colormap range permissible for the
image type. For example, for a 16-bit image, the pixel data will be shown using 0 as black
and 65535 as white. However, if the actual pixel intensities span only a portion of the
image intensity range, this may render the image unviewable. For example, if a 16-bit image
only contains 12 bits of data, the resulting image will be entirely black.</li>
<li><i>Normalized (default):</i> Shows the image with the colormap "autoscaled" to
the maximum and minimum pixel intensity values; the minimum value is black and the
maximum value is white. </li>
<li><i>Log normalized:</i> Same as <i>Normalized</i> except that the color values
are then log transformed. This is useful for when the pixel intensity spans a wide
range of values but the standard deviation is small (e.g., the majority of the 
interesting information is located at the dim values). Using this option 
increases the effective contrast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Interpolation:</i> Presents three options for displaying the resolution in 
the images. This is useful for specifying the amount of detail that you want to be 
visible if you zoom in:
<ul>
<li><i>Nearest neighbor:</i> Use the intensity of the nearest image pixel when 
displaying screen pixels at sub-pixel resolution. This produces a blocky image, 
but the image accurately reflects the data.</li>
<li><i>Linear:</i> Use the weighted average of the four nearest image pixels when 
displaying screen pixels at sub-pixel resolution. This produces a smoother, more
visually-appealing image, but makes it more difficult to find pixel borders.</li>
<li><i>Cubic: </i> Perform a bicubic interpolation of the nearby image pixels when
displaying screen pixels at sub-pixel resolution. This produces the most 
visually-appealing image but is the least faithful to the image pixel values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Save subplot:</i> Save the clicked subplot as an image file. If there is only one p
lot in the figure, this option will save that one.</li>
<li><i>Channels:</i> For color images only. You can show any combination of the red, 
green, and blue color channels.</li>
</ul>
