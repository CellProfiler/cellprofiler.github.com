<body><h1>Selecting Images for Input</h1>
<div>

<p>Any image analysis project using CellProfiler begins with providing the program with a set of image files
to be analyzed. You can do this by clicking on
the <b>Images</b> module to select it (located in the Input modules panel on the left); this module is responsible for collecting
the names and locations of the files to be processed.</p>

<p>The most straightforward way to provide files to the <b>Images</b> module is 
to simply drag-and-drop them from your file manager tool (e.g., Windows Explorer, Finder) onto the file list panel 
(the blank space indicated by the text "Drop files and folders here"). 
Both individual files and entire folders can be dragged onto this panel, and as many folders and files can be 
placed onto this panel as needed. As you add files, you will see a listing of the files appear in the panel.</p>

<p>CellProfiler supports a wide variety of image formats, including most of those used in imaging, by using a library called
Bio-Formats; see <a href="http://loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/formats">here</a> for the formats available. Some image formats are better 
than others for image analysis. Some are <a href="http://www.techterms.com/definition/lossy">"lossy"</a> 
(information is lost in the conversion to the format) like most JPG/JPEG files; others are 
<a href="http://www.techterms.com/definition/lossless">lossless</a> (no image information is lost). For image analysis purposes, a 
lossless format like TIF or PNG is recommended.</p>

<p>If you have a subset of files that you want to analyze from the full list shown in the 
panel, you can also filter the files according to a set of rules that you specify. This is useful when, for example, you
have dragged a folder of images onto the file list panel, but the folder contains the images
from one experiment that you want to process along with images from another experiment that you
want to ignore for now. You may specify as many rules as necessary to define the desired 
list of images.</p>

module and clicking the <img src="images\module_help.png">&nbsp;button at the bottom of the pipeline panel, or check out
