<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>CreateWebPage</title></head><body><h1>Module: CreateWebPage</h1><div><b>Create Web Page</b> creates the html file for a webpage to display images  (or their thumbnails, if desired). <hr> This module creates an html file that displays the specified images, and optionally a link to a compressed ZIP file of all of the images shown. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the input images</h4><div>
            Select the images to display on the web page.</div><h4>Use thumbnail images?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to display thumbnail images (small versions of the 
            images) on the web page that link to the full images. <br>
            Select <i>No</i> to display the full image directly on the web page.
            <p>If you are going to use thumbnails, you will need to load
            them using <b>LoadImages</b> or <b>LoadData</b>; you can run a separate 
            pipeline prior to this one to create thumbnails from your originals  
            using the <b>Resize</b> and <b>SaveImages</b> modules. For some high-content
            screening systems, thumbnail files are automatically created and have
            the text "thumb" in the name.</p></div><h4>Select the thumbnail images</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if using thumbnails)</i><br>
            Select the name of the images to use for thumbnails.</div><h4>Webpage file name</h4><div>
            Enter the desired file name for the web page. <b>CreateWebPage</b>
            will add the .html extension if no extension is specified.
            If you have metadata associated with your images, you can name the 
            file using metadata tags. 
You can insert a previously defined metadata tag by either using:
<ul><li>The insert key</li>
<li>A right mouse button click inside the control</li>
<li>In Windows, the Context menu key, which is between the Windows key and Ctrl key </li></ul>
The inserted metadata tag will appear in green. To change a previously inserted metadata tag, 
navigate the cursor to just before the tag and either:
<ul><li>Use the up and down arrows to cycle through possible values.</li>
<li>Right-click on the tag to display and select the available values.</li></ul><br>
            For instance, if you have metadata tags named "Plate" and 
            "Well", you can create separate per-plate, per-well web pages based on
            your metadata by inserting the tags "Plate_Well" to specify the 
            name. Please see the <b>Metadata</b> module for more details on metadata collection and usage.</div><h4>Select the folder for the .html file</h4><div>
            This setting determines how <b>CreateWebPage</b> selects the 
            folder for the .html file(s) it creates. 
            <ul>
            <li><i>Same as the images</i>: Place the .html file(s) in the same folder as 
            the files.</li>
            <li><i>One level over the images</i>: Place the .html file(s) in the
            image files' parent folder.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Webpage title</h4><div>
            This is the title that appears at the top of the browser
            window. If you have metadata associated with your images, you can name the 
            file using metadata tags. 
You can insert a previously defined metadata tag by either using:
<ul><li>The insert key</li>
<li>A right mouse button click inside the control</li>
<li>In Windows, the Context menu key, which is between the Windows key and Ctrl key </li></ul>
The inserted metadata tag will appear in green. To change a previously inserted metadata tag, 
navigate the cursor to just before the tag and either:
<ul><li>Use the up and down arrows to cycle through possible values.</li>
<li>Right-click on the tag to display and select the available values.</li></ul>For instance, if you 
            have a metadata tag named "Plate", you can type "Plate: " and then insert 
            the metadata tag "Plate" to display the plate metadata item. Please see the <b>Metadata</b> module for more details on metadata collection and usage.</div><h4>Webpage background color</h4><div>
            This setting controls the background color for the web page.</div><h4>Number of columns</h4><div>
            This setting determines how many images are displayed
            in each row.</div><h4>Table border width</h4><div>
            The table border width determines the width of the border
            around the entire grid of displayed images (i.e., the "table" of images) 
            and is measured in pixels. This value can be 
            set to zero, in which case you will not see the table border.</div><h4>Image spacing</h4><div>
            The spacing between images ("table cells"), in pixels.</div><h4>Image border width</h4><div>
            The image border width determines the width of
            the border around each image and is measured in pixels.
            This value can be set to zero, in which case you will not see the 
            image border.</div><h4>Open new window when viewing full image?</h4><div>
            This controls the behavior of the thumbnail links. 
            <ul>
            <li><i>Once only:</i> Your browser will open a new window
            when you click on the first thumbnail and will display subsequent
            images in the newly opened window. </li>
            <li><i>For each image:</i> The browser will open a new window each time
            you click on a link.</li>
            <li><i>No:</i> The browser will reuse the current window
            to display the image</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Make a ZIP file containing the full-size images?</h4><div>
            ZIP files are a common archive and data compression file format, making 
            it convenient to download all of the images represented on the web page with a single click.
            Select <i>Yes</i> to create a ZIP file that contains all your images, 
            compressed to reduce file size.</div><h4>Enter the ZIP file name</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if creating a ZIP file)</i><br>
            Specify the name for the ZIP file.</div></div></body></html>
