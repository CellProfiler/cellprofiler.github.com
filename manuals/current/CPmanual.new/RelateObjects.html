<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>RelateObjects</title></head><body><h1>Module: RelateObjects</h1><div><b>Relate Objects</b> assigns relationships; all objects (e.g. speckles) within a parent object (e.g. nucleus) become its children. <hr> This module allows you to associate <i>child</i> objects with <i>parent</i> objects.  This is useful for counting the number of children associated with each parent, and for calculating mean measurement values for all children that are associated with each parent.<p><p>An object will be considered a child even if the edge is the only part touching a parent object. If an child object is touching multiple parent objects, the object will be assigned as a child of all parents that it overlaps with.<p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <b>Parent object measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Count:</i> The number of child sub-objects for each parent object.</li> <li><i>Mean measurements:</i> The mean of the child object measurements, calculated for each parent object.</li> <li><i>Distances:</i> The distance of each child object to its respective parent.</li> </ul><p><b>Child object measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Parent:</i> The label number of the parent object, as assigned by an <b>Identify</b> module.</li> </ul><p>See also: <b>ReassignObjectNumbers</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the input child objects</h4><div>
            Child objects are defined as those objects contained within the
            parent object. For example, when relating speckles to the
            nuclei that contains them, the speckles are the children.</div><h4>Select the input parent objects</h4><div>
            Parent objects are defined as those objects which encompass the 
            child object. For example, when relating speckles to the
            nuclei that contains them, the nuclei are the parents.</div><h4>Calculate child-parent distances?</h4><div>
            Choose the method to calculate distances of each child to its parent.
            <ul>
            <li><i>None:</i> Do not calculate any distances.</li>
            <li><i>Minimum:</i> The distance from the 
            centroid of the child object to the closest perimeter point on
            the parent object.</li>
            <li><i>Centroid:</i> The distance from the
            centroid of the child object to the centroid of the parent. </li>
            <li><i>Both:</i> Calculate both the <i>Minimum</i> and 
            <i>Centroid</i> distances.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Calculate per-parent means for all child measurements?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to calculate the per-parent mean values of every upstream 
            measurement made with the children objects and stores them as a
            measurement for the parent; the nomenclature of this new measurements is 
            "Mean_&lt;child&gt;_&lt;category&gt;_&lt;feature&gt;". 
            For this reason, this module should be placed <i>after</i> all <b>Measure</b>
            modules that make measurements of the children objects.</div><h4>Calculate distances to other parents?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if calculating distances)</i><br>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to calculate the distances of the child objects to 
            some other objects. These objects must be either parents or
            children of your parent object in order for this module to
            determine the distances. For instance, you might find "Nuclei" using
            <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>, find "Cells" using
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b> and find "Cytoplasm" using
            <b>IdentifyTertiaryObjects</b>. You can use <b>Relate</b> to relate
            speckles to cells and then measure distances to nuclei and
            cytoplasm. You could not use <b>RelateObjects</b> to relate speckles to
            cytoplasm and then measure distances to nuclei, because nuclei is
            neither a direct parent or child of cytoplasm.</div><h4>Parent name</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if calculating distances to another parent)</i><br>
            Choose the name of the other parent. The <b>RelateObjects</b> module will 
            measure the distance from this parent to the child objects
            in the same manner as it does to the primary parents.
            You can only choose the parents or children of
            the parent object.</div></div></body></html>
