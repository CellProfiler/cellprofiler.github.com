<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>MaskImage</title></head><body><h1>Module: MaskImage</h1><div><b>Mask Image</b> hides certain portions of an image (based on previously identified  objects or a binary image) so they are ignored by subsequent mask-respecting modules  in the pipeline. <hr> This module masks an image and saves it in the handles structure for future use. The masked image is based on the original image and the masking object or image that is selected. If using a masking image, the mask is  composed of the foreground (white portions); if using a masking object, the mask  is composed of the area within the object.<p>Note that the image created by this module for further processing  downstream is grayscale. If a binary mask is desired in subsequent modules, use  the <b>ApplyThreshold</b> module instead of <b>MaskImage</b>.<p>See also <b>ApplyThreshold</b>, <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>, <b>IdentifyObjectsManually</b>.<p></div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the input image</h4><div>
            Select the image that you want to mask.</div><h4>Name the output image</h4><div>
            Enter the name for the output masked image.</div><h4>Use objects or an image as a mask?</h4><div>
            You can mask an image in two ways:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Objects</i>: Using objects created by another
            module (for instance <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>). The module
            will mask out all parts of the image that are not within one
            of the objects (unless you invert the mask).</li>
            <li><i>5(IO_IMAGE)s</i>: Using a binary image as the mask, where black 
            portions of the image (false or zero-value pixels) will be masked out.
            If the image is not binary, the module will use
            all pixels whose intensity is greater than 0.5 as the mask's
            foreground (white area). You can use <b>ApplyThreshold</b> instead to create a binary
            image and have finer control over the intensity choice.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Select object for mask</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if mask is to be made from objects)</i> <br> 
            Select the objects you would like to use to mask the input image.</div><h4>Select image for mask</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if mask is to be made from an image)</i> <br> 
            Select the image that you like to use to mask the input image.</div><h4>Invert the mask?</h4><div>This option reverses the foreground/background relationship of
            the mask. 
            <ul>
            <li>Select <i>No</i> to produce the mask from the foregound 
            (white portion) of the masking image or the area within the masking 
            objects.</li>
            <li>Select <i>Yes</i>to instead produce the mask from the 
            <i>background</i> (black portions) of the masking image or the area 
            <i>outside</i> the masking objects.</li>
            </ul></div></div></body></html>
