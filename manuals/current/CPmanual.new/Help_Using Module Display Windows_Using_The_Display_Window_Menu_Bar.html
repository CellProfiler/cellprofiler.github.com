<body><h1>Using The Display Window Menu Bar</h1>
<div>

From the menu bar of each module display window, you have the following options:
<ul>
<li><b>File</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Save:</i> You can save the figure window to an image file. Note that this will save the entire
contents of the window, not just the individual subplot(s) or images.</li>
<li><i>Save table:</i> This option is only enabled on windows which are displaying
tabular output, such as that from a <b>Measure</b> module. This allows you to
save the tabular data to a comma-delimited file (CSV).</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Tools</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Measure length: </i> Select this option to measure distances within an image window. 
If you click on an image and drag, a line will appear 
between the two endpoints, and the distance between them shown at the right-most
portion of the bottom panel. This is useful for measuring distances in order to obtain
estimates of typical object diameters for use in <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Subplots:</b> If the module display window has multiple subplots (such as 
<b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>), the Image Tool options for the individual subplots 
are displayed here. See <i>Help > Using Module Display Windows > How To Use The Image Tools</i> for more details.
</li>
</ul>
