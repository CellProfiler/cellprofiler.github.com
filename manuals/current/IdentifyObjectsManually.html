The user interface has several mouse tools:<br> <ul><li><i>Outline:</i> Lets you draw an outline around an object. Press the left mouse button at the start of the outline and draw the outline around your object. The tool will close your outline when you release the left mouse button.</li> <li><i>Zoom in:</i> Lets you draw a rectangle and zoom the display to within that rectangle.</li> <li><i>Zoom out:</i> Reverses the effect of the last zoom-in.</li> <li><i>Erase:</i> Erases an object if you click on it.</li></ul> </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the input image</h4><div>
            Choose the name of the image to display in the object
            selection user interface.</div><h4>Name the objects to be identified</h4><div>
            What do you want to call the objects
            that you identify using this module? You can use this name to
            refer to your objects in subsequent modules.</div><h4>Retain outlines of the identified objects?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to retain the outlines of the new objects 
for later use in the pipeline. For example, a common use is for quality control purposes by 
overlaying them on your image of choice using the <b>OverlayOutlines</b> module and then saving 
the overlay image with the <b>SaveImages</b> module.</div><h4>Name the outlines</h4><div>
            
<i>(Used only if the outline image is to be retained for later use in the pipeline)</i> <br>
Enter a name for the outlines of the identified 
objects. The outlined image can be selected in downstream modules by selecting 
them from any drop-down image list.</div></div></body></html>
