<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>OverlayOutlines</title></head><body><h1>Module: OverlayOutlines</h1><div><b>Overlay Outlines</b> places outlines produced by an  <b>Identify</b> module over a desired image. <hr> This module places outlines (in a special format produced by an <b>Identify</b> module)  on any desired image (grayscale, color, or blank). The  resulting image can be saved using the <b>SaveImages</b> module.<p>See also <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects, IdentifySecondaryObjects, IdentifyTertiaryObjects</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Display outlines on a blank image?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to produce an
            image of the outlines on a black background. 
            <p>Select <i>No</i>, the module will overlay the 
            outlines on an image of your choosing.</p></div><h4>Select image on which to display outlines</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when a blank image has not been selected)</i> <br>
            Choose the image to serve as the background for the outlines.
            You can choose from images that were loaded or created by modules
            previous to this one.</div><h4>Name the output image</h4><div>
            Enter the name of the output image with the outlines overlaid. 
            This image can be selected in later modules (for instance, <b>SaveImages</b>).</div><h4>Outline display mode</h4><div>
            Specify how to display the outline contours around
            your objects. Color outlines produce a clearer display for
            images where the cell borders have a high intensity, but take
            up more space in memory. Grayscale outlines are displayed with
            either the highest possible intensity or the same intensity
            as the brightest pixel in the image.</div><h4>Select method to determine brightness of outlines</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when outline display mode is grayscale)</i> <br>
            The following options are possible for setting the intensity 
            (brightness) of the outlines:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Max of image:</i> Set the brighness to the 
            the same as the brightest point in the image.</li>
            <li><i>Max possible:</i> Set to the maximum 
            possible value for this image format.</li>
            </ul>
            If your image is quite dim, then putting bright white lines
            onto it may not be useful. It may be preferable to make the
            outlines equal to the maximal brightness already occurring 
            in the image.</div><h4>Width of outlines</h4><div>
            Enter the width, in pixels, of the
            outlines to be displayed on the image.</div><h4>Select outlines to display</h4><div>
            Choose outlines to display, from a previous <b>Identify</b>
            module. Each of the <b>Identify</b> modules has a checkbox that
            determines whether the outlines are saved. If you have checked this,
            you were asked to supply a name for the outline; you
            can then select that name here.
            </div><h4>Load outlines from an image or objects?</h4><div>Prior versions of <b>OverlayOutlines</b> would only
            display outline images which were optional outputs of the identify
            modules. For legacy pipelines or to continue using the outline
            images instead of objects, choose <i>Image</i>. Choose
            <i>Objects</i> to create the image directly from the
            objects. This option will improve the functionality of the
            contrast options for this module's interactive display and will
            save memory.
            </div><h4>Select objects to display</h4><div>Choose the objects whose outlines you would like
        to display.</div></div></body></html>
