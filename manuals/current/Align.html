<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>Align</title></head><body><h1>Module: Align</h1><div><b>Align</b> aligns images relative to each other, for example, to correct  shifts in the optical path of a microscope in each channel of a multi-channel  set of images. <hr> For two or more input images, this module determines the optimal alignment  among them. Aligning images is useful to obtain proper measurements of the  intensities in one channel based on objects identified in another channel,  for example. Alignment is often needed when the microscope is not perfectly  calibrated. It can also be useful to align images in a time-lapse series of  images.  The module stores the amount of shift between images as a measurement, which can be useful for quality control purposes. <p><p>Note that the second image (and others following) is always aligned  with respect to the first image. That is, the X/Y offsets indicate how much the second image needs to be shifted by to match the first.</p><p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <ul>  <li><i>XShift, Yshift:</i> The pixel shift in X and Y of the   aligned image with respect to the original image.</li> </ul> </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the alignment method</h4><div>
             Two options for the alignment method are available:<br>
             <ul>
             <li><i>Mutual Information:</i> This more general method works well for aligning
             images from different modalities that contain the same information, but are 
             expressed differently. However, this method performs better than Normalized Cross Correlation, 
             even in the same modality, if the images are not highly correlated.  
             It is iterative, and thus tends to be slower than other methods, 
             but is more likely to be correct.  Essentially, alignment is performed by measuring
             how well one image "explains" the other. For example, a flourescent image 
             can be aligned to a brightfield image by this method since the relevant 
             features are bright in one modality where they are dim in the other. </li>
             <li><i>Normalized Cross Correlation:</i> This is a good means 
             of alignment in the case of images acquired with the same modality
             (e.g., all images to be aligned are fluorescent). It is fast, however 
             it can be highly influenced by a particular, possibly spurious, feature and 
             in turn generate anomalously large shifts. It allows for a
             linear relationship between the intensities of the two images, 
             i.e., the relevant features in the images to be aligned all have
             varying degrees of brightness.</li>
             </ul>

            The crop mode determines how the output images are either cropped
            or padded after alignment. The alignment phase calculates the
            areas in each image that are found to be overlapping. In almost
            all cases, there will be portions of some or all of the images
            that don't overlap with any other aligned image. These portions
            have no counterpart and will be excluded from analysis. There
            are three choices for cropping:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Crop to aligned region:</i> Crop every image to the region that overlaps 
            in all images. This makes downstream
            analysis simpler because all of the output images
            have authentic pixel data at all positions, however it discards
            parts of images. Also, the output images may not be the same size
            as the input images which may cause problems if downstream modules
            use aligned and unaligned images (which may be of differing sizes)
            in combination.</li>
            <li><i>Pad images:</i> Align every image and pad with masked black
            pixels to make each image the same size. This results in larger
            images, but preserves all information in each of the images. This
            may be the best choice if images undergo an operation such as
            smoothing that could use the information that would otherwise be
            cropped.</li>
            <li><i>Keep size:</i> Maintain the sizes of the images but
            align them, masking the unaligned portions with black pixels. 
            <b>Align</b> aligns all images relative to the first. 
            This is a reasonable option for alignments
            with small displacements since it maintains a consistent image
            size which may be useful if output images from different image sets
            will be compared against each other after processing. The
            reference image can also be used across image sets. For example,
            the reference image could be loaded for all image sets in a
            group to align the entire group's images similarly, then the
            aligned images could be combined in a module such as
            <b>MakeProjection</b>.</li>
