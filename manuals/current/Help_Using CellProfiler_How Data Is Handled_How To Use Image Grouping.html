<body><h1>How To Use Image Grouping</h1>
<div>

<p>In some instances, you may want to subdivide an image set into groups that share a common feature.
For example, if you are performing illumination correction, we usually recommend that the illumination
function be calculated on a per-plate basis, and hence each plate should be processed independently.
Since running the same pipeline multiple times (one for each grop) would be time-consuming, CellProfiler
is able to perform image grouping for this purpose. If the image subdivisions are distinguishable by some metadata
(usually defined within the filename or folder location), grouping will enable you to
process those images that have the metadata together.</p>

<p>To use grouping, you must define the relevant metadata for each image. This can be done using regular
expressions in <b>LoadImages</b> or having them pre-defined in a .csv for use in <b>LoadData</b>.</p>

<p>To use image grouping in <b>LoadImages</b>, please note the following:
<ul>
<li><i>Metadata tags must be specified for all images listed.</i> You cannot use
grouping unless an appropriate regular expression is defined for all the images listed
in the module.</li>
<li><i>Shared metadata tags must be specified with the same name for each image listed.</i> For example, if you 
are grouping on the basis of a metadata tag "Plate" in one image channel, you
must also specify the "Plate" metadata tag in the regular expression for the other channels that you 
want grouped together.</li>
</ul>
<p> 
Please see <b>LoadImages</b>, <b>LoadData</b>, or <i>Help > Using CellProfiler > How Data Is Handled > Using Metadata In CellProfiler</i> 
for more details on obtaining, extracting, and using metadata tags from your images</p>
