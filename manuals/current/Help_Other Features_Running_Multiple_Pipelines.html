<body><h1>Running Multiple Pipelines</h1>
<div>

<br>The <b>Run multiple pipelines</b> dialog lets you select several pipelines
which will be run consecutively. Please note the following:
<ul>
<li>CellProfiler 2.1 project files are not currently supported.</li>
<li>Pipelines from CellProfiler 2.0 and lower are supported.</li>
<li>If you want to use a pipeline made using CellProfiler 2.1, then you
need to include the project file list with the pipeline, by selecting <i>Export &gt;
Pipeline...</i>, and under the "Save as type" dropdown, select "CellProfiler
pipeline and file list".</li>
</ul>

<p>You can invoke <b>Run multiple pipelines</b> by selecting it from the file menu. 
The dialog has three parts to it:
<br><ul><li><i>File chooser</i>: The file chooser lets you select the pipeline
files to be run. The <i>Select all</i> and <i>Deselect all</i> buttons to
the right will select or deselect all pipeline files in the list. The
<i>Add</i> button will add the pipelines to the pipeline list. You can add
a pipeline file multiple times, for instance if you want to run that pipeline
on more than one input folder.</li>
<li><i>Directory chooser</i>: The directory chooser lets you navigate to
different directories. The file chooser displays all pipeline files in the
directory chooser's current directory.</li>
<li><i>Pipeline list</i>: The pipeline list has the pipelines to be run in
the order that they will be run. Each pipeline has a default input and
output folder and a measurements file. You can change any of these by clicking
on the file name - an appropriate dialog will then be displayed. You can
click the remove button to remove a pipeline from the list</li></ul>
<br>
CellProfiler will run all of the pipelines on the list when you hit the
"OK" button.</div></body>
