<body><h1>Using The Interactive Navigation Toolbar</h1>
<div>

All figure windows come with a navigation toolbar, which can be used to navigate through the data set.
<ul>
<li><b>Home, Forward, Back buttons:</b>
<i>Home</i> <img src="images\window_home.png"> always takes you to 
the initial, default view of your data. The <i>Forward</i> <img src="images\window_forward.png">&nbsp;
and <i>Back</i> <img src="images\window_back.png">&nbsp;buttons are akin 
to the web browser forward and back buttons in that they are used to navigate back 
and forth between previously defined views, one step at a time. They will not be 
enabled unless you have already navigated within an image else using 
the <b>Pan</b> and <b>Zoom</b> buttons, which are used to define new views. </li>

<li><b>Pan/Zoom button:</b>
This button has two modes: pan and zoom. Click the toolbar button 
<img src="images\window_pan.png"> to activate panning 
and zooming, then put your mouse somewhere over an axes, where it will turn into a hand
icon. 
<ul>
<li><i>Pan:</i> Press the left mouse button and hold it to pan the figure, dragging it to a new 
position. Press Ctrl+Shift with the pan tool to move in one axis only, which one you
have moved farther on.<br>
Keep in mind that that this button will allow you pan outside the bounds of
the image; if you get lost, you can always use the <b>Home</b> to back you back to the
initial view.</li>
<li><i>Zoom:</i> You can zoom in and out of a plot by pressing Ctrl (Mac)
or holding down the right mouse button (Windows) while panning. <br>
Once you're done, the right click menu will pop up when you're done with the action; dismiss it by 
clicking off the plot. This is a known bug to be corrected in the next release.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Zoom-to-rectangle button:</b> Click this toolbar button <img src="images\window_zoom_to_rect.png">&nbsp;
to activate this mode. To zoom in, press the left mouse button and drag in the window 
to draw a box around the area you want to zoom in on. When you release the mouse button, 
the image is re-drawn to display the specified area. Remember that you can always use 
<i>Backward</i> button to go back to the previous zoom level, or use the <i>Home</i> 
button to reset the window to the initial view.</li>

<li><b>Save:</b> Click this button <img src="images\window_filesave.png">&nbsp;
to launch a file save dialog. You can save the figure window to an image file. 
Note that this will save the entire contents of the window, not just the individual 
subplot(s) or images.</li>
</ul>
