<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>OutputExternal</title></head><body><h1>Module: OutputExternal</h1><div><b>Output External</b> specfies which images can be made available to external sources (e.g., Java) <hr> <b>OutputExternal</b> is a helper module for ImageJ. <b>Do not add it to  a pipeline.</b><p><p>The <b>InputExternal</b> and <b>OutputExternal</b> modules are  placeholders if CellProfiler is run programatically. For example, another program, e.g., a plugin to ImageJ, is provided with  a CellProfiler pipeline. This program should then replace the input modules with <b>InputExternal</b> modules and prompt the user what inputs  should be supplied to the pipeline through <b>InputExternal</b>. The program  should also specify which inputs are to be sent back to the source program  via <b>OutputExternal</b>. The calling program would insert the images into  the image set before running the pipeline and remove the images from the  image set at the end.</p><p>See also <b>RunImageJ</b> </div></body></html>
