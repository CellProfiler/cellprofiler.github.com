<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>EditObjectsManually</title></head><body><h1>Module: EditObjectsManually</h1><div><b>Edit Objects Manually</b> allows you create, remove and edit objects previously defined. <hr> The interface will show the image that you selected as the guiding image, overlaid with colored outlines of the selected objects (or filled objects if you choose). This module allows you to remove or edit specific objects  by pointing and clicking to select objects for removal or editing. Once editing is complete, the module displays the objects as originally identified (left) and the objects that remain after this module (right).<p>More detailed Help is provided in the editing window via the '?' button.<p>The pipeline pauses once per processed image when it reaches this module. You must press the <i>Done</i> button to accept the selected objects and continue the pipeline.<p><h4>Available measurements</h4> <b>Image measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Count:</i> The number of edited objects in the image.</li> </ul> <b>Object measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Location_X, Location_Y:</i> The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the center of mass of the edited objects.</li> </ul><p>See also <b>FilterObjects</b>, <b>MaskObject</b>, <b>OverlayOutlines</b>, <b>ConvertToImage</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Select the objects to be edited</h4><div>
            Choose a set of previously identified objects
            for editing, such as those produced by one of the
            <b>Identify</b> modules.</div><h4>Name the edited objects</h4><div>
            Enter the name for the objects that remain
            after editing. These objects will be available for use by
            subsequent modules.</div><h4>Retain outlines of the edited objects?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> if you want to keep images of the outlines
            of the objects that remain after editing. This image
            can be saved by downstream modules or overlayed on other images
            using the <b>OverlayOutlines</b> module.</div><h4>Name the outline image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if you have selected to retain outlines of edited objects)</i><br>
            Enter a name for the outline image.</div><h4>Numbering of the edited objects</h4><div>
            Choose how to number the objects that 
            remain after editing, which controls how edited objects are associated with their predecessors:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Renumber:</i> The module will number the objects that remain 
            using consecutive numbers. This
            is a good choice if you do not plan to use measurements from the
            original objects and you only want to use the edited objects in downstream modules; the
            objects that remain after editing will not have gaps in numbering
            where removed objects are missing.</li>
            <li><i>Retain:</i> This option will retain each object's original number so that the 
            edited object's number matches its original number. This allows any measurements you make from 
            the edited objects to be directly aligned with measurements you might 
            have made of the original, unedited objects (or objects directly 
            associated with them).</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Display a guiding image?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to display an image and outlines of the objects. <br>
            Select <i>No</i> if you do not want a guide image while editing</div><h4>Select the guiding image</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if a guiding image is desired)</i><br>
            This is the image that will appear when editing objects.
            Choose an image supplied by a previous module.</div><h4>Allow overlapping objects?</h4><div>
            <b>EditObjectsManually</b> can allow you to edit an
            object so that it overlaps another or it can prevent you from
            overlapping one object with another. Objects such as worms or
            the neurites of neurons may cross each other and might need to
            be edited with overlapping allowed, whereas a monolayer of cells
            might be best edited with overlapping off. <br>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to allow overlaps or select <i>No</i> 
            to prevent them.</div></div></body></html>
