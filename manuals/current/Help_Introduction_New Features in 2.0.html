<body><h1>New Features in 2.0</h1>
<div>
 
A number of new features have been incorporated into this re-engineered Python 
version of CellProfiler:
<h3>Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>Resizable user interface: </i>The main CellProfiler interface can now be resized
by dragging the window corner.</li>
<li><i>Help for individual module settings:</i> Every setting in every module now has 
a help button that you can click to display information and advice for that setting.</li>
<li><i>Settings verification:</i> CellProfiler constantly checks for setting values  
that are not allowed, and immediately flags them for you.</li>
<li><i>Context-dependent module settings</i>: Prior versions of CellProfiler 
displayed all settings for each module, whether or not the values were necessary, 
given existing choices for other settings. Now, only those settings 
you require are displayed, simplifying the interface.</li>
<li><i>Test mode for assay development:</i> This feature allows you to 
preview the effect of a module setting on your data. You can step backward or forward 
in the pipeline as you modify settings, optimizing your results prior to running an
actual analysis.</li>
<li><i>Unlimited number of http://d1zymp9ayga15t.cloudfront.net/images/objects as module input:</i> Some modules can accept an arbitrary number 
of images or objects as input, and you can dynamically add or remove any of these inputs as needed.
For example, you can specify any number of single images in LoadSingleImage; previously,
the module could accept only three input images at a time. For example, in OverlayOutlines, you can specify that any number of outlines be  
overlaid on an image; previously, you would have had to string multiple OverlayOutline modules
together.</li>
<li><i>Image grouping:</i> Images which share common metadata tags, whether 
provided in the filename or in an accompanying text data file, can be processed together.
This is useful for any situation in which the images are organized
in groups  and each group needs to be analyzed as an individual set, such as 
illumination correction for multiple plates.</li>
<li><i>Module drag and drop:</i> You can drag and drop selected modules  
within a pipeline or into another instance of CellProfiler, keeping their associated 
settings intact.</li>
<li><i>Listing of recent pipelines:</i> A selectable list of recently used pipelines
is available from the menu bar, for easy access.</li>
<li><i>Figure display choice:</i> Easier access to which module figure display windows are shown.
This functionality is now controlled within the pipeline, and is saved as part of the pipeline.
<li><i>Context menus:</i>  The pipeline panel responds to right-clicks, providing 
easy access to module manipulation or help.</li>
<li><i>Error handling:</i> This feature sends bug reports (stack traces) to our developers.
<li><i>Better access for developers:</i> We are providing a developer's guide 
as a practical introduction for programming in the CellProfiler environment, an 
email list, and wiki, in addition to the available user forum.
</ul>

<h3>Module improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>Improved Otsu thresholding:</i> Choose two- or three-class thresholding to handle
images where there might be an intermediate intensity level between foreground and 
background.</li>
<li>Secondary object identification now permits discarding of objects touching 
the image border, along with the associated primary objects.</li>
<li>Filtering objects by measurements now permits a set of objects to be filtered
with any number of measurements. </li>
<li><i>Masking of http://d1zymp9ayga15t.cloudfront.net/images/objects:</i> You can create masks for use with both
images and objects such that image/object measurements will include only those
regions within the masked area.</li>
<li><i>Improved loading of text information:</i> Previously, you could load only a
limited amount of annotation relevant to your images, via a text file. Now you can use  
comma-delimited files to load tables of metadata, in addition to file lists of input 
images for analysis.</li>
<li><i>Convex hull</i> has been included as an image morphological operation.</li>
<li>A new module, MeasureNeurons, has been added, which measures the number 
of trunks and branches for each neuron in an image.</li>
<li><i>Detection of new features:</i> Neurites can be extracted from images of neurons.
Branching points of line segments can be found as an image morphological operation.
Also, "dark holes" (dark spots surrounded bright rings) can be detected. </li>
<li><i>Improvements to object tracking:</i> A new tracking algorithm has been added
to the TrackObjects module which is capable of bridging temporal gaps in trajectories
and accounting for splitting/merging events.</li>
<li><i>Per-object data exporting:<i> Object data can be exported to a database as a single table containing
all user-defined object measurements, or as separate tables, one for each object.
<li><i>SQLite support:</i> Data can be exported in SQLite, a 
self-contained database format. Users can create their own local databases and 
no longer need access to a separate database server. Because CellProfiler 
Analyst also supports SQLite, any user can access CellProfiler Analyst's
suite of data exploration and machine-leaning tools without installing a complicated database server.</li>
</ul>
