<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>StraightenWorms</title></head><body><h1>Module: StraightenWorms</h1><div><b>StraightenWorms</b> straightens untangled worms. <hr> <b>StraightenWorms</b> uses the objects produced by <b>UntangleWorms</b> to create images and objects of straight worms from the angles and control points as computed by <b>UntangleWorms</b>. The resulting images can then be uniformly analyzed to find features that correlate with position in an ideal representation of the worm, such as the head or gut.<p><b>StraightenWorms</b> works by calculating a transform on the image that translates points in the image to points on the ideal worm. <b>UntangleWorms</b> idealizes a worm as a series of control points that define the worm's shape and length. The training set contains measurements of the width of an ideal worm at each control point. Together, these can be used to reconstruct the worm's shape and correlate between the worm's location and points on the body of an ideal worm.<p><b>StraightenWorms</b> produces objects representing the straight worms and images representing the intensity values of a source image mapped onto the straight worms. The objects and images can then be used to compute measurements using any of the object measurement modules, for instance, <b>MeasureTexture</b>.<p>The module can be configured to make intensity measurements on parts of the worm, dividing the worm up into pieces of equal width and/or height.  Measurements are made longitudally in stripes from head to tail and transversely in segments across the width of the worm. Longitudinal stripes are numbered from left to right and transverse segments are numbered from top to bottom. The module will divide the worm into a checkerboard of sections if configured to measure more than one longitudinal stripe and transverse segment. These are numbered by longitudinal stripe number, then transverse segment number. For instance, "Worm_MeanIntensity_GFP_L2of3_T1of4", is a measurement of the mean GFP intensity of the center stripe (second of 3 stripes) of the topmost band (first of four bands). Measurements of longitudinal stripes are designated as  "T1of1" indicating that the whole worm is one transverse segment. Likewise  measurements of transverse segments are designated as "L1of1" indicating that there is only one longitudinal stripe. Both mean intensity and standard deviation of intensity are measured per worm sub-area.<p>While <b>StraightenWorms</b> can straighten a color image, the module needs a grayscale image to make its intensity measurements. For a color image, the red, green and blue channels are averaged to yield a grayscale image. The intensity measurements are then made on that grayscale image.<p><h4>Available measurements</h4><p><b>Object measurements:</b> <ul> <li><i>Location_X, Location_Y:</i> The pixel (X,Y) coordinates of the primary  object centroids.

            This is the name of the objects produced by the
            <b>UntangleWorms</b> module. <b>StraightenWorms</b> can use
            either the overlapping or non-overlapping objects as input. It
            will use the control point measurements associated with the objects
            to reconstruct the straight worms. You can also use objects
            saved from a previous run and loaded via the <b>Input</b> modules, objects
            edited using <b>EditObjectsManually</b> or objects from one
            of the Identify modulues. <b>StraightenWorms</b>
            will recalculate the control points for these images.</div><h4>Name the output straightened worm objects</h4><div>
            This is the name that will be given to the straightened
            worm objects. These objects can then be used in a subsequent
            measurement module.</div><h4>Worm width</h4><div>
            This setting determines the width of the image of each
            worm. The width should be set to at least the maximum width of
            any untangled worm, but can be set to be larger to include the
            worm's background in the straightened image.</div><h4>Training set file location</h4><div>
            Select the folder containing the training set to be loaded.
            
You can choose among the following options which are common to all file input/output 
modules:
<ul>
<li><i>Default Input Folder</i>: Use the default input folder.</li>
<li><i>Default Output Folder:</i> Use from the default output folder.</li>
<li><i>Elsewhere...</i>: Use a particular folder you specify.</li>
<li><i>Default input directory sub-folder</i>: Enter the name of a subfolder of 
the default input folder or a path that starts from the default input folder.</li>
<li><i>Default output directory sub-folder</i>: Enter the name of a subfolder of 
the default output folder or a path that starts from the default output folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Elsewhere</i> and the two sub-folder options all require you to enter an additional 
path name. You can use an <i>absolute path</i> (such as "C:\imagedir\image.tif" on a PC) or a 
<i>relative path</i> to specify the file location relative to a directory):
<ul>
<li>Use one period to represent the current directory. For example, if you choose 
<i>Default Input Folder sub-folder</i>, you can enter "./MyFiles" to look in a 
folder called "MyFiles" that is contained within the Default Input Folder.</li>
<li>Use two periods ".." to move up one folder level. For example, if you choose 
<i>Default Input Folder sub-folder</i>, you can enter "../MyFolder" to look in a 
folder called "MyFolder" at the same level as the Default Input Folder.</li>
</ul></p>

            <p>An additional option is the following:
            <ul>
            <li><i>URL</i>: Use the path part of a URL. For instance, your
            training set might be hosted at 
            <i>http://my_institution.edu/server/my_username/TrainingSet.xml</i>
            To access this file, you would choose <i>URL</i> and enter
            <i>http://my_institution.edu/server/my_username/</i>
            as the path location.</li>
            </ul></p></div><h4>Training set file name</h4><div>This is the name of the training set file.</div><h4>Measure intensity distribution?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to divide a worm into sections
            and measure the intensities of each section in each of the
            straightened images. These measurements can help classify
            phenotypes if the staining pattern across the segments differs
            between phenotypes.</div><h4>Number of transverse segments</h4><div>
            (<i>Only used if intensities are measured</i>)<br>
            This setting controls the number of segments measured, dividing
            the worm longitudally into transverse segments starting at the head 
            and ending at the tail.
            These measurements might be used to identify a phenotype in which
            a stain is localized longitudally, for instance, in the head.
            
            Set the number of vertical segments to 1 to only measure intensity
            in the horizontal direction.</div><h4>Number of longitudinal stripes</h4><div>
            (<i>Only used if intensities are measured</i>)<br>
            This setting controls the number of stripes measured, dividing
            the worm transversely into areas that run longitudally. These
            measurements might be used to identify a phenotype in which a
            stain is localized transversely, for instance in the gut of the
            worm.
            
            Set the number of horizontal stripes to 1 to only measure intensity
            in the vertical direction.</div><h4>Align worms?</h4><div>
            (<i>Only used if intensities are measured</i>)<br>
            <b>StraightenWorms</b> can align worms so that the brightest
            half of the worm (the half with the highest mean intensity) is
            at the top of the image or at the bottom of the image. This
            can be used to align all worms similarly if some feature,
            such as the larynx, is stained and is always at the same end
            of the worm. Choose <i>Top brightest</i> if the brightest part of the
            worm should be at the top of the image, <i>Bottom brightest</i> if the
            brightest part of the worm should be at the bottom or
            <i>Do not align</i> if the worm should not be aligned.
            Choose <i>Flip manually</i> to bring up an editor for every
            cycle that allows you to choose the orientation of each worm.</div><h4>Alignment image</h4><div>
            (<i>Only used if aligning worms</i>)<br>
            This is the image whose intensity will be used to align the worms.
            You must use one of the straightened images below.</div><h4>Select an input image to straighten</h4><div>
            This is the name of an image that will be straightened
            similarly to the worm. The straightened image and objects can
            then be used in subsequent modules such as
            <b>MeasureObjectIntensity</b>.</div><h4>Name the output straightened image</h4><div>
            This is the name that will be given to the image
            of the straightened worms.</div></div></body></html>
