            This option lets you choose which images will have quality metrics calculated.
            <ul>
            <li><i>All loaded images:</i> Use all images loaded with the <b>Input</b> modules. 
            The quality metrics selected below will be applied to all loaded images.</li>
            <li><i>Select...:</i> Select the desired images from a list. The quality 
            metric settings selected will be applied to all these images. Additional lists 
            can be added with separate settings.</li>
            </ul></div><h4>Select the images to measure</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if "Select..." is chosen for selecting images)</i><br>
            Choose one or more images from this list. You can select multiple images by clicking 
            using the shift or command keys. In addition to loaded images, the list includes
            the images that were created by prior modules.</div><h4>Include the image rescaling value?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to add the image's rescaling
            value as a quality control metric. This value is set only for images
            that loaded using the <b>Input</b> modules. This is useful in confirming
            that all images are rescaled by the same value, since some acquisition 
            device vendors may output this value differently.
            See <b>NamesAndTypes</b> for more information.</div><h4>Calculate blur metrics?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to compute a series of blur metrics. The blur metrics are the
            following, along with recomendations on their use:
            <ul>
            <li><i>PowerLogLogSlope:</i> The power spectrum contains the frequency information
            of the image, and the slope gives a measure of image blur. A higher slope indicates 
            more lower frequency components, and hence more blur (<i>Field, 1997</i>). This metric is 
            recommended for blur detection in most cases.</li>
            <li><i>Correlation:</i> This is a measure of the image spatial intensity distribution 
            computed across sub-regions of an image for a given spatial scale (<i>Haralick, 1973</i>).
            If an image is blurred, the correlation between neighboring pixels becomes high, 
            producing a high correlation value. A similar approach was found to give optimal 
            performance for fluorescence microscopy applications (<i>Vollath, 1987</i>). <br>
            Some care is required in selecting an appropriate spatial scale because differences 
            in the spatial scale capture various features: moderate scales capture the 
            blurring of intracellular features better than small scales and larger scales 
            are more likely to reflect intercellular confluence than focal blur. A spatial scale
            no bigger than the feature of interest is recommended, although you can select as
            many scales as desired.</li>
            <li><i>FocusScore:</i> This score is calculated using a normalized variance, 
            which was the best-ranking algorithm for brightfield, phase contrast, and DIC images 
            (<i>Sun, 2004</i>). Higher focus scores correspond to lower bluriness. <br>
            More specifically, the focus score computes the intensity variance of the entire
            image divided by mean image intensity. Since it is tailored for autofocusing 
            applications (difference focus for the same field of view), it assumes that the 
            overall intensity and the number of objects in the image is constant, making it less 
            useful for comparision images of different fields of view. For distinguishing 
            extremely blurry images, however, it performs well.</li>
            <li><i>LocalFocusScore:</i> A local version of the Focus Score, it subdivides the
            image into non-overlapping tiles, computes the normalized variance for each, and 
            takes the mean of these values as the final metric. It is potentially more useful 
            for comparing focus between images of different fields of view, but is subject
            to the same caveats as the Focus Score. It can be useful in differentiating good versus
            badly segmented images in the cases when badly segmented images usually contain no cell 
            objects with high background noise.</li>

            <i>(Used only if blur measurements are to be calculated)</i> <br> 
            The <i>LocalFocusScore</i> is measured within an <i>N &times; N</i> pixel 
            window applied to the image, whereas the <i>Correlation</i> of a pixel is 
            measured with repsect to its neighbors <i>N</i> pixels away. 
            <p>A higher number for the window size measures larger patterns of 
            image blur whereas smaller numbers measure more localized patterns of 
            blur. We suggest selecting a window size that is on the order of the feature of interest 
            (e.g., the object diameter). You can measure these metrics for multiple window sizes 
            by selecting additional scales for each image.</p></div><h4>Calculate saturation metrics?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to calculate the saturation metrics <i>PercentMaximal</i>
            and <i>PercentMinimal</i>, i.e., the percentage of pixels at
            the upper or lower limit of each individual image.  
            <p>For this calculation, the hard limits of 0 and 1 are not used because images often
            have undergone some kind of transformation such that no pixels
            ever reach the absolute maximum or minimum of the image format.  Given
            the noise typical in images, both these measures should be a low percentage but if the
            images were saturated during imaging, a higher than usual
            <i>PercentMaximal</i> will be observed, and if there are no objects, the
            <i>PercentMinimal</i> value will increase.</p></div><h4>Calculate intensity metrics?</h4><div>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to calculate image-based
            intensity measures, namely the mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation
            and median absolute deviation of pixel intensities. These measures
            are identical to those calculated by <b>MeasureImageIntensity</b>.</div><h4>Calculate thresholds?</h4><div>
            Automatically calculate a suggested 
            threshold for each image. One indicator of image quality is that these threshold
            values lie within a typical range. 
            Outlier images with high or low thresholds often contain artifacts.</div><h4>Use all thresholding methods?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if image thresholds are calculcated)</i><br>
            Select <i>Yes</i> to calculate thresholds using all the available methods. Only the global methods
            are used. <br>
            While most methods are straightfoward, some methods have additional 
            parameters that require special handling:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Otsu:</i> Thresholds for all combinations of class number, minimzation 
            parameter and middle class assignment are computed.</li>
            <li><i>Mixture of Gaussians (MoG):</i> Thresholds for image coverage fractions 
            of 0.05, 0.25, 0.75 and 0.95 are computed.</li>
            </ul>
            See the <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> module for more information on thresholding
            methods.</div><h4>Select a thresholding method</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if particular thresholds are to be calculated)</i> <br> 
            This setting allows you to apply automatic thresholding 
            methods used in the <b>Identify</b> modules. Only the global methods are applied.
            For more help on thresholding, see the <b>Identify</b> modules.</div><h4>Typical fraction of the image covered by objects</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if threshold are calculated and MoG thresholding is chosen)</i> <br> 
            Enter the approximate fraction of the typical image in the set
            that is covered by objects.</div><h4>Two-class or three-class thresholding?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if thresholds are calculcated and the Otsu thresholding method is used)</i> <br>
            Select <i>Two classes</i> if the grayscale levels are readily distinguishable into foregound 
            (i.e., objects) and background. Select <i>Three classes</i> if there is a  
            middle set of grayscale levels that belongs to neither the
            foreground nor background. 
            <p>For example, three-class thresholding may
            be useful for images in which you have nuclear staining along with a
            low-intensity non-specific cell staining. Where two-class thresholding
            might incorrectly assign this intemediate staining to the nuclei 
            objects, three-class thresholding allows you to assign it to the 
            foreground or background as desired. However, in extreme cases where either 
            there are almost no objects or the entire field of view is covered with 
            objects, three-class thresholding may perform worse than two-class.</div><h4>Assign pixels in the middle intensity class to the foreground or the background?</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only if thresholds are calculcated and the Otsu thresholding method with Three classes is used)</i><br>
            Choose whether you want the middle grayscale intensities to be assigned 
            to the foreground pixels or the background pixels.</div></div></body></html>
