<html style=font-family:arial><head><title>DisplayDataOnImage</title></head><body><h1>Module: DisplayDataOnImage</h1><div><b>Display Data On Image</b>  produces an image with measured data on top of identified objects. <hr> This module displays either a single image measurement on an image of your choosing, or one object measurement per object on top of every object in an image. The display itself is an image which you can save to a file using <b>SaveImages</b>. </div><div><h2>Settings:</h2><h4>Display object or image measurements?</h4><div>
            <ul>
            <li><i>Object</i> displays measurements made on
            objects.</li>
            <li><i>Image</i> displays a single measurement made
            on an image.</li> 
            </ul></div><h4>Select the input objects</h4><div>
            <i>(Used only when displaying object measurements)</i><br>
            Choose the name of objects identified by some previous
            module (such as <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b> or
            <b>IdentifySecondaryObjects</b>).</div><h4>Measurement to display</h4><div>
            Choose the measurement to display. This will be a measurement
            made by some previous module on either the whole image (if
            displaying a single image measurement) or on the objects you
            selected.</div><h4>Select the image on which to display the measurements</h4><div>
            Choose the image to be displayed behind the measurements.
            This can be any image created or loaded by a previous module.
            If you have chosen not to display the background image, the image
            will only be used to determine the dimensions of the displayed image</div><h4>Text color</h4><div>
            This is the color that will be used when displaying the text.
            </div><h4>Name the output image that has the measurements displayed</h4><div>
            The name that will be given to the image with
            the measurements superimposed. You can use this name to refer to the image in
            subsequent modules (such as <b>SaveImages</b>).</div><h4>Image elements to save</h4><div>
            This setting controls the level of annotation on the image:
            <ul>
            <li><i>Image:</i> Saves the image with the overlaid measurement annotations.</li>
            <li><i>Axes:</i> Adds axes with tick marks and image coordinates.</li>
            <li><i>Figure:</i> Adds a title and other decorations.</li></ul></div><h4>Annotation offset (in pixels)</h4><div>
            Add a pixel offset to the measurement. Normally, the text is
            placed at the object (or image) center, which can obscure relevant features of
            the object. This setting adds a specified offset to the text, in a random
            direction.</div><h4>Display mode</h4><div><i>(Used only when displaying object measurements)</i><br>
            Choose how to display the measurement information. If you choose
            Text, <b>DisplayDataOnImage</b> will display the numeric
            value on top of each object. If you choose Color,
            <b>DisplayDataOnImage</b> will convert the image to grayscale, if
            necessary, and display the portion of the image within each object
            using a hue that indicates the measurement value relative to
            the other objects in the set using the default color map.
            </div><h4>Color map</h4><div><i>(Used only when displaying object measurements)</i><br>
            This is the color map used as the color gradient for coloring the
            objects by their measurement values.
            </div><h4>Display background image?</h4><div>Choose whether or not to display the measurements on
            a background image. Usually, you will want to see the image
            context for the measurements, but it may be useful to save
            just the overlay of the text measurements and composite the
            overlay image and the original image later. Choose "Yes" to
            display the measurements on top of a background image or "No"
            to display the measurements on a black background.</div></div></body></html>
