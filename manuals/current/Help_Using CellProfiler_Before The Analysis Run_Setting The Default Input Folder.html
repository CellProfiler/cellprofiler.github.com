<body><h1>Setting The Default Input Folder</h1>
<div>

<p>In the Folder panel, the <i>Default Input Folder</i> contains the input image or data files
that you want to analyze. Several File Processing modules (e.g., 
<b>LoadImages</b> or <b>LoadData</b>) provide the option of retrieving images 
from this folder on a default basis unless you specify, within the module, an alternate, 
specific folder on your computer. Within modules, we recommend selecting the 
Default Input Folder as much as possible, so that your pipeline will 
work even if you transfer your images and pipeline to a different 
computer. If, instead, you type specific folder path names into a module's settings, 
your pipeline will not work on someone else's computer until you adjust those
pathnames within each module.</p>

<p>Use the <i>Browse</i> button <img src="images\folder_browse.png"></img> to specify 
the folder you would like to use as the Default Input Folder, or 
type the full folder path in the edit box. If you type a folder path that  
cannot be found, the message box below will indicate this fact until you correct the problem. 
If you want to specify a folder that does not yet exist, type the desired name and 
click on the <i>New folder</i> button <img src="images\folder_create.png"></img>.
The folder will be created according to the pathname you have typed.</p>

<p>The contents of the Default Input Folder are shown in the file panel to the left.
Double-clicking image file names in this panel opens them in a figure window.             
If you double-click on .mat pipeline or output files (CellProfiler 1.0) or .cp 
pipeline files (CellProfiler 2.0), you will be asked if you want to load a       
pipeline from the file. To refresh the contents of this panel, click the <i>Refresh</i>
button <img src="images\folder_refresh.png"></img>.</p></div></body>
