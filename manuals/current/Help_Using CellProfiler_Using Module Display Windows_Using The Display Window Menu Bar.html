<body><h1>Using The Display Window Menu Bar</h1>
<div>

From the menu bar of each module display window, you have the following options:
<ul>
<li><b>File</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Save</i>: You can save the figure window to a file (currently,
Postscript (.PS), PNGs and PDFs are supported). Note that this will save the entire
contents of the window, not just the individual subplot(s) or images.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Tools</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Measure length: </i> Select this option to measure distances within an image window. 
If you click on an image and drag, a line will appear 
between the two endpoints, and the distance between them shown at the right-most
portion of the bottom panel. This is useful for measuring distances in order to obtain
estimates of typical object diameters for use in <b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Subplots:</b> If the module display window has multiple subplots (such as 
<b>IdentifyPrimaryObjects</b>), the Image Tool options for the individual subplots 
are displayed here. See <i>%(IMAGE_TOOLS_HELP_REF)</i> for more details.
</li>
</ul>
</div></body>
