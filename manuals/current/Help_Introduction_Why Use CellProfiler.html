<body><h1>Why Use CellProfiler</h1>
<div>


<p>Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use 
light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There 
is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated 
microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information 
sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.</p>

<p>CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data 
from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments. CellProfiler 
is designed for modular, flexible, high-throughput analysis of images, measuring 
size, shape, intensity, and texture of every cell (or other object) in every image. 
Using the point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), users construct an image 
analysis "pipeline", a sequential series of modules that each perform 
an image processing function such as illumination correction, object identification 
(segmentation), and object measurement. Users mix and match modules and adjust 
their settings to measure the phenotype of interest. While originally designed for 
high-throughput images, it is equally appropriate for low-throughput assays as 
well (i.e., assays of < 100 images).</p>

<p>CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly 
while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. It helps researchers 
approach a variety of biological questions quantitatively, including standard 
assays (e.g., cell count, size, per-cell protein levels) as well as complex 
morphological assays (e.g., cell/organelle shape or subcellular patterns of DNA 
or protein staining).</p>

<p>The wide variety of measurements produced by CellProfiler serves as useful "raw material" for machine learning algorithms. CellProfiler's companion software, CellProfiler Analyst, has an interactive machine learning tool called Classifier which can learn to recognize a phenotype of interest based on your guidance. Once you complete the training phase, CellProfiler Analyst will score every object in your images based on CellProfiler's measurements.  CellProfiler Analyst also contains tools for the interactive visualization of the data produced by CellProfiler.</p>

<p>In summary, CellProfiler contains:
<ul>
<li>Advanced algorithms for image analysis that are able to accurately identify 
crowded cells and non-mammalian cell types.</li>
<li>A modular, flexible design allowing analysis of new assays and phenotypes.</li>
<li>Open-source code so the underlying methodology is known and can be modified 
or improved by others.</li>
<li>A user-friendly interface.</li>
<li>The capability to make use of clusters of computers when available.</li>
<li>A design that eliminates the tedium of the many steps typically involved in 
image analysis, many of which are not easily transferable from one project to
another (for example, image formatting, combining several image analysis steps, 
or repeating the analysis with slightly different parameters).</li>
</ul>
