                            <p>BLOSSOMS (Blended Learning Science or Math Studies) is a large, free repository of video modules for high school math and science classes created by "star" teachers from around the world. Each video is designed for viewing
                                in brief segments, allowing the in-class teacher between segments to engage the class in an active, goal-oriented exercise. The goal is not just to learn about an exciting area of science but also to develop deeper and
                                richer thinking skills.</p>

                                <p>This exercise will allow students to learn about how image analysis can be applied to screening chemicals for antibiotic drugs. The data is from a published study in which the nematode</p><i>C.
elegans
 was used as an animal model to find small molecules
 that cure infection by the</i><i>E.faecalis
 pathogen. In this
exercise, you will have access to the following materials:</i>

                                    <li>Background information on bacterial resistance, antibiotic discovery and C. elegans as a model organism for antibiotic research.

                                    <li>Images from an actual screen in which several compounds and extracts were found to rescue the worms from infection but had not previously been reported to have antimicrobial properties.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The exercise is written as a set of modules, such that the activities can be done up until any point. Modules can be combined to create a lesson plan appropriate for students ranging from high-school up to upper-level college
                                    biology students.</p>

                                <p>This exercise will demonstrate how image analysis can be used for novel drug discovery. Students will use CellProfiler identify and delineate cells and cellular sub-compartments, and collect and store measurements from
                                    each cell. Afterwards, they will use CellProfiler Analyst to visualize their data, and use its machine learning tool to train the computer to distinguish between treated and untreated cells</p>

                                <p>This exercise will introduce students to the image-analysis challenges in using co-culture systems as part of a novel<i>in
vitro</i></p>
                                <p>liver model. Students will use CellProfiler to generate a suite of cellular measurements, followed by training the supervised learning tool in CellProfiler Analyst to discriminate between hepatocytes and fibroblasts. The
                                    student will then learn how including additional tailored image features can improve classification.
