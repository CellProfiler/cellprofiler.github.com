- title: Untangle worms
  category: WormToolbox
  description: In this pipeline, we identify individual worms and extract shape and intensity measurements. Worm untangling requires a worm model, which is provided together with the pipeline. If adjusting the pipeline to fit your own data, worm detection will likely improve by creating a new worm model based on your own image data.

  category: WormToolbox
  description: Once worms are untangled, this pipeline shows how they can be straightened and aligned with a low-resolution worm atlas to extract localized intensity measurements and compare patterns of reporter signals. Included are steps for identifying secondary objects (fluorescent marker signals) and relating these objects to individual worms, enabling count of signals on a per-worm basis.

- title: Untangle worms and make measurements bright-field staining pattern phenotype
  category: WormToolbox
  description: This pipeline detects individual worms by worm untangling and finds sub-objects (fatty regions stained with oil red O) within the worms. Using bright-field data only, it detects fatty regions by intensity thresholding in a single image channel and relates the fatty regions to individual worms. This enables detection of rare phenotypes in heterogeneous populations, phenotypes that would be missed if population averages were observed.
