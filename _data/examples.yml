# Worm Toolbox

- section: Worm Toolbox
  description: These pipelines have been developed for high-throughput screens on <i>C. elegans</i> and extract measurements on a per-worm basis. The <a href="/wormtoolbox">Worm Toolbox</a> page has further details on this workflow, as well as video tutorials, pipelines and image data in addition to those described below. (from C Wählby <i>et al.</i> Methods, 2014) The <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/bbbc">BBBC</a> also has <i>C. elegans</i> sample images and information, as well as assay "ground truth" of various kinds.

- example_name: Untangle worms
  id: untangle-worms
  description: In this pipeline, we identify individual worms and extract shape and intensity measurements. Worm untangling requires a worm model, which is provided together with the pipeline.

- example_name: Untangle worms and make measurements bright-field staining pattern phenotype
  id: untangle-worms-and-make-measurements-bright-field-staining-pattern-phenotype
  description: This pipeline detects individual worms by worm untangling and finds sub-objects (fatty regions stained with oil red O) within the worms. Using bright-field data only, it detects fatty regions by intensity thresholding in a single image channel and relates the fatty regions to individual worms. This enables detection of rare phenotypes in heterogeneous populations, phenotypes that would be missed if population averages were observed.
