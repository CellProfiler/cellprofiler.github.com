  text_1: The main analysis pipeline, Pipeline 1, shown in blue, is fully automated, and consists of the following steps-
  list_item_1: <li>Load input images from QORO assay. Pre-process to detect artifacts such as bubbles and well edges.</li>
  list_item_2: <li>Detect worms and clusters of worms. Individual worms/worm clusters are randomly colored.</li>
  list_item_3: <li>Delineate individual worms by model-based worm untangling. Now, each individual detected worm has a unique color.</li>
  list_item_4: <li>Digitally straighten worms and align them to a simple worm atlas for measurement of stain distribution.</li>
  list_item_5: <li>Detect fatty regions within worms. Once worms and fatty regions are identified, a large number of intensity, shape and texture measurements are extracted.</li>
  text_2: If the provided default worm model does not fit the input data (e.g. due to a different image resolution or different worm strain), a new worm model can be created using Pipeline 2 (pink) to (g) manually select non-touching worms making up a training set for a new model built by Pipeline 3.
  text_3: For low-throughput experiments, it is possible to manually curate faulty segmentation results using Pipeline 4 (orange) by (h) manual editing of the output from step d of pipeline 1, and (i) manual flipping of digitally straightened worms so that they all align in with heads or tails up. Measurements, such as intensity of stain, fat stain distribution, fat region size, worm width etc. may also be extracted from individual worms after manual correction. All measurements are exported to a database for further exploration and phenotyping.
  text_4: Note that CellProfiler 2.1 should be used.
