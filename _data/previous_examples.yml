- title: Untangle worms
  category: WormToolbox
  description: In this pipeline, we identify individual worms and extract shape and intensity measurements. Worm untangling requires a worm model, which is provided together with the pipeline. If adjusting the pipeline to fit your own data, worm detection will likely improve by creating a new worm model based on your own image data.

- title: Create your own worm model
  category: WormToolbox
  description: The UntangleWorms module has an "Untangle" mode and a "Train" mode. This pipeline describes how the "Train" mode is used to create a worm model. Training consists of providing a large number of images of worms that are representative of the worm variation within the population, and that do not touch or overlap. Note that this example download includes only two images and will not result in a good model, as it will not be representative of all possible variations of the worm shapes. We recommend using at least 60 worms to create a model.

Using bright-field data only, it detects fatty regions by intensity thresholding in a single image channel and relates the fatty regions to individual worms. This enables detection of rare phenotypes in heterogeneous populations, phenotypes that would be missed if population averages were observed.
