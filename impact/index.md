                    <p>Our CellProfiler software has yielded
                        discoveries in several translational
                        projects, some of which may ultimately have
                        a direct impact on the treatment of
                        disease. For example, CellProfiler has been
                        used to identify several small molecules
                        that are effective in treating particular
                        diseases in mouse models. In some cases,
                        discoveries made using CellProfiler have
                        even led to planning clinical trials in
                        humans, which could directly improve
                        patient outcomes. Here we highlight
                        instances that have come to our attention.

                            <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of global
                                concern due in part to increasingly
                                antibiotic-resistant bacteria. CellProfiler
                                was used in a high-throughput screen of
                                bioactive small molecules to identify those
                                that inhibited growth of Mycobacterium
                                tuberculosis (Mtb) within host cells by
                                targeting host functions and pathways.
                                Notably, among the identified effective
                                compounds were fluoxetine (commonly known
                                as Prozac) and gefitinib, used clinically
                                for treating depression and cancer,
                                respectively. Gefitinib was subsequently
                                demonstrated to reduce Mtb growth in the
                                lungs of infected mice. In addition to
                                identifying new pathways likely to be
                                relevant for TB pathogenesis, this work
                                demonstrated that targeting the host may be
                                a viable adjunctive approach for treating
                            TB.</p>

                                <p>CellProfiler helped to identify novel
                                    compounds that may lead to potential
                                    treatments for a form of leukemia involving
                                    human megakaryocytes (AMKL). Most cancer
                                    treatments work by targeting cancer cells
                                    for death as compared to normal cells. By
                                    contrast, the goal here was to search for
                                    drugs that can induce polyploidy, which
                                    restrains the cancerous cellsâ€™ uncontrolled
                                    growth by causing them to differentiate
                                    into a terminal state. Over 200
                                    polyploidization regulators were identified
                                    from a 10,000 compound screen. One hit in
                                    particular, dimethylfasudil, a broad kinase
                                    inhibitor of Aurora kinase A, also
                                    succeeded in inducing polyploidy in an AMKL
                                    mouse model. The team turned its attention
                                    to the Aurora-A inhibitor Alisertib which
                                    is already under clinical investigation for
                                    a variety of tumors. Follow-up work by the Crispino lab <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26569382">extends the potential utility of Aurora-A inhibitors to primary myelofibrosis</a>.</p>
