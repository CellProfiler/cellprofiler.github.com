Getting Started
===============

**CellProfiler** is free, open-source software for quantitative analysis of biological images. No prior experience in programming or computer vision is required â€“ this page is intended to help you get up and running.

The quickest way to get up and running with CellProfiler is to
1. Download [CellProfiler](/releases).
2. Launch it by double clicking ([Troubleshooting](https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler/wiki/Windows-Installation-Troubleshooting))
3. The welcome screen pops up: choose the example pipeline (if you are connected to the internet) and run it.
4. Find an example pipeline and images ([here](/examples)) that are similar to yours and un it.
5. Adjust the pipeline to your own images.
6. Post at the [online forum](http://forum.cellprofiler.org) if you have any trouble.
